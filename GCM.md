#### **GCM Vector: A Coordinate in a Metric Space (Manifold)**

- **Representation:** $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2]$.
    
    - Axis 1 _is_ "Hue." Axis 2 _is_ "Brightness."
        
    - These axes are derived (often via MDS) to represent the psychological structure of the stimuli.
        
- **The Math:** This is a **Continuous [[Metric Space]]** (specifically, a [[Minkowski space]]).
    
- **Property:** **Ordinality matters.** A value of $0.5$ is closer to $0.6$ than it is to $0.9$. The distance $|x_i - y_i|$ is the fundamental unit of similarity.
