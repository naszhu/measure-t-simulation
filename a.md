# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1. The Importance of Episodic Memory

Episodic memory, the ability to consciously recollect specific past experiences along with their contextual details, represents one of the most remarkable achievements of the human cognitive system (Tulving, 1983, 2002). This form of memory allows us to mentally travel back in time, re-experiencing not just the content of past events but also the rich tapestry of contextual information that surrounded them—where we were, when it happened, who was present, and how we felt (Conway, 2009; Rubin, 2006). The significance of episodic memory extends far beyond mere information storage; it fundamentally shapes our sense of self, guides our decision-making, and enables us to navigate complex social environments (Schacter et al., 2007; Suddendorf & Corballis, 2007).

From a functional perspective, episodic memory serves multiple adaptive purposes. It allows us to learn from specific past experiences without requiring repeated exposure, enables flexible use of past information to solve novel problems, and facilitates social bonding through the sharing of personal experiences (Klein et al., 2002; Schacter & Addis, 2007). The constructive nature of episodic memory also supports future thinking and planning, as the same neural mechanisms that allow us to remember the past are recruited when we imagine future scenarios (Addis et al., 2007; Schacter et al., 2017).

The study of episodic memory has revealed its complex architecture, involving multiple brain regions working in concert, with the hippocampus playing a central role in binding together disparate elements of an experience (Eichenbaum, 2017; Moscovitch et al., 2016). Damage to the episodic memory system, as seen in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or hippocampal amnesia, can have devastating consequences for an individual's ability to function independently and maintain a coherent sense of identity (Addis & Tippett, 2008; Rosenbaum et al., 2005).

## 1.2. The Concept of Context in Memory Research

### 1.2.1. Defining Context vs. Content

One of the fundamental distinctions in memory research is that between content and context. Content refers to the focal information or the "what" of an experience—the specific items, facts, or events that are the primary targets of encoding and retrieval (Polyn et al., 2009). Context, on the other hand, encompasses the circumstances surrounding the focal content—the "when," "where," and "how" of the experience (Godden & Baddeley, 1975; Smith & Vela, 2001). This distinction, while conceptually clear, becomes more nuanced when we consider that what constitutes content versus context can shift depending on the goals of the rememberer and the demands of the retrieval situation (Murnane et al., 1999).

Context can be broadly categorized into external (environmental) and internal (cognitive/emotional) components. External context includes physical features of the environment such as location, ambient sounds, odors, and visual surroundings (Isarida & Isarida, 2007; Smith, 1979). Internal context comprises the individual's mental state, including mood, physiological state, and ongoing thoughts or strategies (Eich, 1980; Goodwin et al., 1969). Additionally, temporal context—the position of an item within a temporal sequence or the time of encoding—represents a crucial contextual dimension that has received considerable attention in recent theories (Howard & Kahana, 2002; Polyn et al., 2009).

The content-context distinction has important implications for understanding memory organization and retrieval. While content information is often thought to be processed in a relatively stable manner, context is inherently dynamic, changing continuously as time passes and situations evolve (Mensink & Raaijmakers, 1988; Sahakyan & Hendersen, 2022). This dynamic nature of context poses significant challenges for memory systems, which must somehow capture and utilize contextual information that is constantly in flux.

### 1.2.2. The Dynamic Nature of Context

The recognition that context is not static but rather continuously evolving has profoundly influenced modern theories of memory (Howard et al., 2015; Polyn & Kahana, 2008). Unlike the traditional view of context as a fixed backdrop against which memories are encoded, contemporary models conceptualize context as a gradually drifting representation that changes moment by moment (Estes, 1955; Mensink & Raaijmakers, 1988). This drift in context is thought to occur at multiple timescales, from rapid fluctuations over seconds to slower changes over minutes, hours, or even days (Folkerts et al., 2018; Manning et al., 2011).

The dynamic nature of context has several important implications. First, it provides a natural explanation for the temporal organization of memory—items studied close together in time share more similar contexts and are therefore more likely to be recalled together (Howard & Kahana, 2002; Kahana, 1996). Second, context drift creates a fundamental trade-off in memory retrieval: while a continuously changing context provides a unique temporal tag for each experience, it also means that the retrieval context will inevitably differ from the encoding context, potentially hampering memory access (Sederberg et al., 2008).

Recent neuroimaging studies have provided compelling evidence for the dynamic nature of context representations in the brain. Using pattern analysis techniques, researchers have shown that neural representations in regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gradually drift over time, even in the absence of explicit task demands (DuBrow & Davachi, 2014; Schapiro et al., 2016). Moreover, the rate of this neural drift appears to be modulated by event boundaries and can predict subsequent memory performance (Clewett & Davachi, 2017; Ezzyat & Davachi, 2011).

## 1.3. The Role of Context in Memory Storage and Retrieval

Context plays a dual role in episodic memory, influencing both how memories are initially stored and how they are later retrieved. During encoding, contextual information becomes bound to content representations, creating integrated memory traces that preserve not just what happened but also the circumstances of the experience (Diana et al., 2007; Ranganath, 2010). This binding process is thought to be mediated by the hippocampus, which creates conjunctive representations linking items to their contexts (Davachi, 2006; Eichenbaum et al., 2007).

The influence of context on memory storage extends beyond simple association formation. Context can modulate the depth and elaboration of encoding, with distinctive or unusual contexts often leading to better memory for associated content (Hunt & Worthen, 2006; Schmidt, 1991). Furthermore, context can organize memories into coherent episodes or events, with shared context serving as a organizational principle that groups related experiences together (DuBrow & Davachi, 2013; Zacks et al., 2007).

At retrieval, context serves as a powerful cue that can facilitate access to stored memories. The encoding specificity principle, one of the most robust findings in memory research, states that memory is optimized when the retrieval context matches the encoding context (Tulving & Thomson, 1973). This context-dependent memory effect has been demonstrated across a wide range of contextual manipulations, from environmental context (Godden & Baddeley, 1975) to internal states (Eich, 1980) and even social contexts (Macken, 2002).

However, the role of context in retrieval is more nuanced than simple matching. Context reinstatement—the mental recreation of the encoding context—can occur spontaneously or through deliberate effort, and neuroimaging studies have shown that successful retrieval is associated with the neural reinstatement of encoding contexts (Bowen & Spaniol, 2017; Gordon et al., 2014). Moreover, partial context reinstatement can sometimes be sufficient to trigger successful retrieval, suggesting that memory systems can use incomplete contextual cues flexibly (Gershman et al., 2013).

## 1.4. Challenges in Studying Context

Despite its theoretical importance, studying context empirically presents numerous methodological and conceptual challenges. One fundamental issue is the difficulty in precisely defining and manipulating context. Unlike content, which can be clearly specified (e.g., a particular word or image), context is inherently multidimensional and often difficult to control experimentally (Lehman & Malmberg, 2013; Smith, 1988). Even in carefully controlled laboratory settings, participants bring their own internal contexts—thoughts, emotions, and associations—that cannot be fully controlled or measured (Sahakyan & Kelley, 2002).

Another significant challenge is the temporal dynamics of context. Because context is continuously changing, it is difficult to determine which aspects of context are encoded with a particular item and which contextual features will be most effective as retrieval cues (Klein et al., 2007; Mensink & Raaijmakers, 1989). This problem is compounded by the fact that context change can occur at multiple timescales simultaneously, making it challenging to isolate the effects of context at any particular temporal resolution (Wahlheim & Huff, 2015).

The measurement of context effects also presents methodological hurdles. Many context effects are subtle and require large sample sizes or sensitive dependent measures to detect reliably (Smith & Vela, 2001). Moreover, context effects can interact with other variables such as retention interval, material type, and individual differences, making it difficult to draw general conclusions about the role of context in memory (Isarida & Isarida, 2014; Macken, 2002).

Finally, there are theoretical challenges in understanding how context should be represented in formal models of memory. Questions remain about whether context should be conceptualized as a unitary construct or as comprising multiple independent components, how context representations change over time, and how context interacts with content during encoding and retrieval (Kahana et al., 2008; Logan et al., 2021). These theoretical uncertainties have led to a proliferation of different modeling approaches, each making different assumptions about the nature of context.

## 1.5. Overview of Computational Models of Memory (Briefly introducing REM)

Computational models have played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of episodic memory by providing formal frameworks for testing theoretical ideas and generating quantitative predictions (Lewandowsky & Farrell, 2011; Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 2002). These models vary in their level of abstraction, from detailed neural network models that attempt to capture biological mechanisms to more abstract mathematical models that focus on functional principles (Norman & O'Reilly, 2003; Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997).

Among the various computational approaches to modeling episodic memory, global matching models have been particularly influential. These models, including SAM (Search of Associative Memory; Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981), MINERVA 2 (Hintzman, 1988), and REM (Retrieving Effectively from Memory; Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997), share the assumption that retrieval involves comparing a probe or cue to all stored memory traces in parallel, with the global similarity determining the memory response (Clark & Gronlund, 1996; Kahana, 2020).

REM, in particular, has proven to be a powerful framework for understanding recognition memory. The model assumes that memories are stored as collections of features, some of which are accurately copied from the studied item while others may be omitted or stored with errors (Malmberg, 2008; Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997). This probabilistic storage assumption naturally accounts for the variability in memory performance and provides a principled way to understand how factors such as study time, repetition, and similarity affect recognition (Criss & McClelland, 2006; Malmberg et al., 2004).

The REM framework has been successfully applied to a wide range of recognition memory phenomena, including the mirror effect (whereby better-remembered items show both higher hit rates and lower false alarm rates), the list-length effect, and the effects of repetition and spacing (Criss & Shiffrin, 2004; Norman & O'Reilly, 2003; Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1998). However, the original REM model did not explicitly incorporate context representations, limiting its ability to account for context-dependent memory effects and the temporal organization of memory (Malmberg & Shiffrin, 2005).

## 1.6. Research Aims and Objectives of the Dissertation

### 1.6.1. Investigating context through recognition paradigms

The primary empirical aim of this dissertation is to investigate how context influences memory storage and retrieval using carefully designed recognition memory paradigms. Recognition memory provides an ideal testing ground for studying context effects because it allows for precise control over study and test conditions while providing rich data about memory decisions (Malmberg, 2008; Yonelinas, 2002). By employing picture stimuli and manipulating various aspects of the study-test procedure across multiple lists, we can examine how different types of context—both changing and unchanging—affect recognition performance.

Specifically, this research aims to address several key questions: How does context change between study and test affect recognition accuracy? How do different types of foils (novel vs. previously seen in different contexts) reveal the use of context in recognition decisions? How does the accumulation of memories across multiple study-test cycles influence the role of context? And how does the method of final testing (random, forward, or backward) interact with context-dependent retrieval processes? By systematically investigating these questions across two major experiments, we aim to develop a comprehensive understanding of context's role in recognition memory.

### 1.6.2. Developing and testing an extended computational model (REM-based)

The second major objective of this dissertation is to develop and test an extended version of the REM model that explicitly incorporates context representations. This modeling effort aims to bridge the gap between empirical findings about context effects and formal theoretical understanding. By extending REM to include both changing context (CC) features that vary between lists and unchanging context (UC) features that remain stable, we can examine how different types of contextual information contribute to recognition decisions.

The extended model will incorporate several key innovations: (1) a formal representation of context drift within and between lists, (2) mechanisms for context reinstatement following test trials, (3) differential storage parameters for context versus content features, and (4) a two-stage retrieval process that uses context to filter memory traces before content-based evaluation. By fitting this model to the empirical data from both experiments, we can test whether these theoretical mechanisms are sufficient to account for the observed patterns of performance and gain insights into the quantitative parameters governing context effects in recognition memory.

## 1.7. Structure of the Dissertation

This dissertation is organized into eight chapters that systematically develop our understanding of context in recognition memory. Following this introduction, Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive review of the literature on context and memory, covering both empirical findings and theoretical frameworks. Chapter 3 presents Experiment 1, which examines picture recognition using novel foils across multiple study-test lists and a final comprehensive test. Chapter 4 describes Experiment 2, which extends this paradigm by incorporating different types of foils to further probe context utilization.

Chapter 5 presents the computational modeling work, describing the extended REM framework and its application to both experiments. This chapter details the model architecture, parameter estimation procedures, and comparison of model predictions to empirical data. Chapter 6 presents a published paper (Lai, Cao, & Shiffrin, 2024) on recognition memory decisions made with short- and long-term retrieval, providing additional theoretical context and modeling insights that complement the main experimental work.

Chapter 7 integrates the empirical and modeling results in a general discussion, highlighting the theoretical contributions of the work and its implications for understanding episodic memory more broadly. Finally, Chapter 8 provides concluding remarks and outlines future directions for research on context and memory. Throughout, the dissertation aims to demonstrate how careful experimental work combined with formal modeling can advance our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying human memory.

# Chapter 2: Literature Review

## 2.1. Theories of Episodic Memory

### 2.1.1. Dual-process theories (familiarity and recollection)

The debate over whether recognition memory relies on one or two distinct processes has been central to memory research for decades (Mandler, 1980; Yonelinas, 2002). Dual-process theories propose that recognition judgments can be based on two qualitatively different types of information: familiarity, a relatively fast and automatic assessment of memory strength, and recollection, a slower process that retrieves specific contextual details about the prior encounter (Jacoby, 1991; Diana et al., 2006). This distinction has profound implications for understanding how context influences recognition memory, as the two processes are thought to differ in their reliance on contextual information.

Familiarity is conceptualized as a continuous signal that reflects the global similarity between a test item and stored memory representations (Hintzman & Curran, 1994; Malmberg, 2008). This process is often described as producing a feeling of "knowing" without specific retrieval of episodic details, similar to recognizing a face as familiar without remembering where or when you encountered the person (Brown & Aggleton, 2001; Mandler, 1980). Empirical support for familiarity-based recognition comes from several sources, including the finding that recognition decisions can be made very quickly (Hintzman & Caulton, 1997), that recognition can occur in the absence of conscious recollection (Gardiner & Java, 1991), and that certain populations with hippocampal damage show preserved recognition despite impaired recall (Aggleton & Brown, 1999).

Recollection, in contrast, involves the retrieval of qualitative information about the study episode, including contextual details such as the source, temporal position, or associated thoughts and feelings (Johnson et al., 1993; Perfect et al., 1996). This process is thought to be threshold-like in nature, either succeeding in retrieving episodic information or failing entirely (Parks & Yonelinas, 2007; Yonelinas, 1994). The phenomenological experience of recollection is often described as "remembering" rather than merely "knowing," and is associated with high confidence and the ability to provide specific details about the encoding context (Tulving, 1985; Wheeler et al., 1997).

The remember/know paradigm has been widely used to study the contribution of recollection and familiarity to recognition decisions (Gardiner, 1988; Rajaram, 1993). In this procedure, participants not only make old/new judgments but also indicate whether they "remember" specific details about the study episode or merely "know" that the item was studied without retrieving specific details. Studies using this paradigm have revealed that many variables have differential effects on remember and know responses: for example, divided attention at encoding reduces remember responses more than know responses (Gardiner & Parkin, 1990), while certain manipulations like changing modality between study and test selectively impact remember judgments (Gregg & Gardiner, 1994).

Another influential approach to separating recollection and familiarity is the process dissociation procedure (Jacoby, 1991, 1998). This method uses inclusion and exclusion test conditions to derive independent estimates of recollection and familiarity. In the inclusion condition, participants respond "old" to any item they recognize, allowing both processes to contribute. In the exclusion condition, participants must respond "old" only to items from a specific source, requiring recollection to oppose familiarity-based responding. Studies using this procedure have provided converging evidence for the dual-process distinction and have revealed how various factors differentially affect the two processes (Jennings & Jacoby, 1997; Toth et al., 1994).

Neuroimaging and lesion studies have provided additional support for dual-process theories by identifying distinct neural substrates for familiarity and recollection (Eichenbaum et al., 2007; Ranganath et al., 2004). Familiarity has been associated with activity in perirhinal cortex and other medial temporal lobe structures, while recollection shows stronger dependence on the hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex (Vilberg & Rugg, 2008; Wagner et al., 2005). Event-related potential (ERP) studies have also identified distinct neural signatures, with familiarity associated with an early frontal effect (300-500 ms) and recollection linked to a later parietal effect (500-800 ms) (Curran, 2000; Rugg & Curran, 2007).

### 2.1.2. Single-process theories

Despite the popularity of dual-process theories, single-process accounts of recognition memory have maintained a strong presence in the literature (Donaldson, 1996; Dunn, 2004; Wixted, 2007). These theories propose that recognition decisions are based on a single continuous memory strength variable, with different phenomenological experiences and behavioral patterns emerging from different regions along this continuum rather than from qualitatively distinct processes (Berry et al., 2012; Squire et al., 2007).

Single-process theories often rely on signal detection theory (SDT) as their mathematical framework (Green & Swets, 1966; Macmillan & Creelman, 2005). In this framework, studied and unstudied items are represented as overlapping distributions of memory strength, and recognition decisions involve setting a criterion along this strength dimension (Wixted, 2020). Items exceeding the criterion are judged "old," while those falling below are judged "new." This simple framework can account for many recognition memory phenomena, including the relationship between hits and false alarms, the effects of criterion shifts, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (Ratcliff et al., 1992; Yonelinas & Parks, 2007).

Proponents of single-process theories argue that many findings cited as evidence for dual processes can be accommodated within a unidimensional strength framework (Dougal & Rotello, 2007; Wais et al., 2008). For example, the curvilinear shape of recognition ROC curves, often taken as evidence for a threshold recollection process, can also be explained by assuming unequal variance in the strength distributions for studied and unstudied items (Glanzer et al., 1999; Ratcliff et al., 1994). Similarly, dissociations between remember and know responses might reflect different criteria along a single strength dimension rather than distinct processes (Donaldson, 1996; Hirshman & Master, 1997).

The debate between single- and dual-process theories has led to increasingly sophisticated empirical tests and model comparisons (Malmberg & Xu, 2007; Yonelinas et al., 2010). Some researchers have proposed hybrid models that incorporate both continuous strength and threshold recollection (Onyper et al., 2010; Wixted & Mickes, 2010), while others have suggested that the distinction between one and two processes may be less important than understanding the computational principles underlying recognition memory (Cox & Shiffrin, 2017; Osth & Dennis, 2015).

Recent developments in single-process theories have incorporated more sophisticated representations of memory traces. For example, global matching models like REM assume that memory strength reflects the similarity between a test probe and all stored memory traces, with this similarity computation potentially capturing some of the complexity attributed to separate processes (Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997; McClelland & Chappell, 1998). These models can produce behavior that appears to reflect distinct processes while maintaining a fundamentally unidimensional decision process (Malmberg et al., 2004; Norman & O'Reilly, 2003).

## 2.2. Context in Memory Models

### 2.2.1. Temporal Context Model (TCM)

The Temporal Context Model (TCM) represents a major theoretical advance in understanding how temporal context influences episodic memory (Howard & Kahana, 2002; Howard et al., 2015). TCM proposes that a gradually changing temporal context signal becomes associated with studied items, providing a mechanism for the temporal organization of memory. This model has been particularly successful in explaining a wide range of free recall phenomena, including temporal contiguity effects, asymmetry in forward versus backward transitions, and long-term recency effects (Kahana et al., 2008; Sederberg et al., 2008).

At the core of TCM is the idea that context evolves through a combination of drift and retrieval-induced changes. When an item is studied or retrieved, it causes the current context to update toward the context associated with that item, a process termed "contextual retrieval" (Howard et al., 2005; Polyn et al., 2009). This bidirectional relationship between items and context creates a rich dynamics that can explain many subtle aspects of memory organization. The model maintains both a slowly drifting context that provides temporal distinctiveness and a more rapidly changing component that captures local temporal structure (Lohnas et al., 2015; Polyn & Kahana, 2008).

TCM has been extended and refined in various ways to account for additional phenomena. The Context Maintenance and Retrieval model (CMR) incorporated semantic associations and source context features, allowing it to explain interactions between temporal and semantic organization (Healey & Kahana, 2014; Polyn et al., 2009). CMR2 further extended the framework to account for intrusion errors and prior-list effects in free recall (Lohnas et al., 2015). These extensions demonstrate the flexibility of the temporal context framework in accommodating diverse memory phenomena while maintaining core theoretical principles.

Neuroimaging studies have provided support for key assumptions of TCM. Using multivariate pattern analysis, researchers have identified gradually drifting context representations in medial temporal lobe and prefrontal regions (Jenkins & Ranganath, 2010; Manning et al., 2011). Moreover, the reinstatement of temporal context during successful retrieval, a central prediction of TCM, has been observed in multiple studies (Manning et al., 2016; Yaffe et al., 2014). These neural findings provide convergent evidence for the psychological reality of temporal context representations.

### 2.2.2. Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) and its variants

The REM model (Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997) takes a different approach to memory representation, focusing on how noisy or incomplete storage of item features affects recognition decisions. In REM, each studied item is stored as a trace containing a subset of its features, with some features accurately copied and others omitted or stored with errors. This probabilistic storage assumption provides a natural account of forgetting and interference effects without requiring additional mechanisms (Criss & Shiffrin, 2004; Malmberg et al., 2004).

Recognition decisions in REM involve comparing the test probe to all stored traces and computing a likelihood ratio that the probe matches one of the studied items versus being a new item. This global matching process, combined with the feature-based representation, allows REM to explain many recognition phenomena, including the list-length effect, the null list-strength effect for recognition, and the word frequency mirror effect (Criss, 2006; Shiffrin et al., 1990). The model's success stems partly from its principled approach to representing uncertainty in memory storage and retrieval.

While the original REM model did not explicitly incorporate context, several extensions have addressed this limitation. REM-II introduced context features that could be used to focus retrieval on relevant traces, providing a mechanism for source memory and list discrimination (Malmberg & Shiffrin, 2005). The bind cue decide model of episodic memory (BCDMEM) further developed the role of context in REM-like frameworks, incorporating both item and context features in the recognition decision process (Dennis & Humphreys, 2001). These extensions maintain the core REM assumptions while adding the flexibility to account for context-dependent retrieval.

Recent developments in REM-based modeling have explored how different types of features contribute to recognition decisions. The feature-based REM model (Criss & Koop, 2015) distinguishes between different feature types (e.g., perceptual, semantic, contextual) and allows for differential storage and retrieval weights. This approach provides a more nuanced understanding of how various information sources combine during recognition. Additionally, hierarchical Bayesian implementations of REM have been developed to better capture individual differences and item effects (Montenegro et al., 2011; Pooley et al., 2011).

### 2.2.3. Other relevant models (e.g., SAM, BCDMEM)

The Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model pioneered many concepts that remain influential in memory modeling, including the distinction between inter-item and item-context associations (Gillund & Shiffrin, 1984; Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981). SAM assumes that retrieval involves a two-stage process: first, memory probes (including context cues) activate stored traces based on their associative strengths, and second, activated traces are sampled and evaluated for retrieval. This architecture naturally accounts for many free recall phenomena, including part-list cuing effects and the buildup of proactive interference (Kimball et al., 2007; Roediger, 1973).

SAM's treatment of context was groundbreaking in several ways. The model distinguished between general context (representing the experimental setting) and specific inter-item associations, allowing it to explain both list-wide and local sequential effects (Mensink & Raaijmakers, 1988). The model also incorporated a mechanism for contextual fluctuation, whereby context gradually changes over time, providing an account of temporal distinctiveness and list discrimination. These ideas about context representation and dynamics have influenced virtually all subsequent models of episodic memory (Malmberg et al., 2019).

The Bind Cue Decide Model of Episodic Memory (BCDMEM) represents another important approach to modeling context in recognition (Dennis & Humphreys, 2001). BCDMEM assumes that recognition decisions are based on the match between the test item plus its current context and the stored memory traces. A key innovation of BCDMEM is its treatment of context noise—the model assumes that false alarms arise primarily from the test context matching irrelevant stored contexts rather than from item confusions. This context noise hypothesis provides an alternative explanation for many phenomena traditionally attributed to item interference (Dennis & Chapman, 2010; Osth & Dennis, 2015).

BCDMEM has been particularly successful in explaining list-length and list-strength effects without assuming item interference. By attributing these effects to increased context noise with longer or stronger lists, the model provides a parsimonious account that differs from interference-based explanations (Dennis et al., 2008; Kinnell & Dennis, 2011). The model has also been extended to account for source memory and plurality discrimination, demonstrating its flexibility in handling various recognition paradigms (Osth et al., 2018).

Other notable models have made important contributions to understanding context in memory. The MINERVA 2 model uses an echo intensity mechanism that naturally incorporates context matching in recognition decisions (Hintzman, 1988). The model's use of multiple traces for repeated items allows it to capture both item and context information in a distributed fashion. The Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) model proposes that the hippocampus rapidly encodes conjunctions of items and contexts while neocortical systems slowly extract statistical regularities (McClelland et al., 1995; Norman & O'Reilly, 2003). This division of labor provides insights into how context-dependent and context-independent memory representations might coexist.

## 2.3. Empirical Findings on Context Effects

### 2.3.1. List length effects

The list length effect—the finding that recognition performance decreases as the number of studied items increases—has been a cornerstone phenomenon for testing theories of recognition memory (Dennis & Humphreys, 2001; Murdock & Kahana, 1993). Early studies consistently found that both hit rates and correct rejection rates declined with increasing list length, suggesting that additional study items create interference that impairs discrimination between studied and unstudied items (Gronlund & Elam, 1994; Strong, 1912). However, the interpretation of these effects has been contentious, with debates centered on whether they reflect item interference, context confusions, or criterion shifts (Buratto & Lamberts, 2008; Dennis et al., 2008).

More recent investigations have revealed that list length effects are more nuanced than initially thought. Several well-controlled studies have found minimal or no list length effects when various confounds are eliminated, such as retention interval differences, attention lapses, or differential rehearsal strategies (Dennis & Chapman, 2010; Kinnell & Dennis, 2011). These findings have led to a reevaluation of theoretical accounts, with some models attributing apparent list length effects to context-related factors rather than direct item interference (Osth & Dennis, 2015).

The role of test format in list length effects has also received considerable attention. While recognition tests often show minimal effects, recall tests consistently show robust decreases with list length (Gillund & Shiffrin, 1984; Ward, 2002). This dissociation suggests that list length may primarily affect retrieval processes that rely on generating candidates from memory rather than discriminating between presented alternatives (Kahana et al., 2005). Furthermore, list length effects interact with other variables such as presentation rate, study-test delay, and material type, indicating that multiple mechanisms may contribute to the phenomenon (Cary & Reder, 2003; Nobel & Shiffrin, 2001).

Recent computational modeling work has provided new insights into list length effects. Models that incorporate context drift and context reinstatement can account for the pattern of results across different paradigms without assuming direct inter-item interference (Lehman & Malmberg, 2013; Malmberg et al., 2
