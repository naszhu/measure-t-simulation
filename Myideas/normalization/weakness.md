## **Weaknesses / Major Obstacles**

### **1. You are implicitly redefining the ontology of TVA objects and features**

TVA assumes _objects are bundles of features with stochastic evidence values_.  
Your framework assumes _objects are atomic elements that expand into feature sets_.

This inversion is conceptually clean, but it is **not how TVA has ever been described**. Reviewers may say you are mixing object-based and feature-based descriptions, and that preceding TVA texts already assume object→feature mappings without invoking topology.

You will need to preempt that critique by emphasizing you are not changing TVA assumptions—just formalizing them.

### **2. The measure-theoretic spaces must reflect neurophysiology more explicitly**

NTVA reviewers will ask:

- Is $\Omega_R$ meant to represent V4? IT? A pooled hierarchical feature space?
    
- Why is a measure-theoretic formalization _preferable_ to standard probabilistic coding?
    

You will need at least _one_ figure showing how real neural populations correspond to measurable subsets.

### **3. The derivation of capacity ($C$) from bounded measure is suggestive but not yet rigorous**

The step from “bounded representational measure” to “approx. K ≈ 4 items” is the paper’s most vulnerable point.

TVA people will want:

- a mapping between _your_ capacity bound and TVA’s empirical parameter estimates (C and K),
    
- demonstration that the measure bound yields the known nonlinearities in whole-report functions.
    

At present, the argument is **conceptually plausible but mathematically thin**.

### **4. The proposed empirical prediction requires careful operationalization**

“Distractor overlap in feature space” is not directly observable. TVA people will ask:

- Does overlap mean identical colors?
    
- Same orientation?
    
- Similarity in some continuous feature metric?
    
- Overlap in receptive fields of early visual areas?
    

You will need to specify a task paradigm. Fortunately, the prediction _is_ testable—but the paper must make the test precise.
