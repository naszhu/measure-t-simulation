Hi Søren,

I found a suitable small 4-key keyboard case on Taobao that can serve as the housing for the response device (screenshot attached). Below is a concise list of the components we would need and the approximate cost:

**• 4-key keyboard case (Taobao): ~61 RMB ≈ 56 DKK**  
**• Arduino Pro Micro (USB-HID capable): ~10 USD ≈ 64 DKK**  
**• Linear mechanical switches (Amazon, small pack): ~60–80 DKK**  
**• Wires and resistors (Taobao): ~10–20 RMB ≈ 10–20 DKK**  
**• Estimated shipping from Taobao:** Typically around **100 RMB (≈90 DKK)** for the first kilogram, with additional weight costing ~**50–60 RMB per kg** (≈45–55 DKK). This gives a reasonable sense of expected shipping costs if more parts are ordered together.

We will need some basic soldering for the connections, but overall the assembly is straightforward.

The total hardware cost per device is roughly **285–310 DKK**, excluding one-time tools like a soldering iron.

Let me know if you'd like me to go ahead with ordering the materials and building a prototype.

Best,  
Lea
