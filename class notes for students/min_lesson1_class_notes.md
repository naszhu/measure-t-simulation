# Min Lesson 1 – Class Notes (Slides 1–19)

## Recap & Focus
- **Foundation reminder:** We write the way the brain can process—start with what readers already know, end with what’s new, and drop key ideas into the stress position.
- **Core skills so far:** Given-New sequencing, stress position control, cognitive load (7 ± 2 rule), disciplined chunking, dialectical thinking, epistemological skepticism, and nominalization.
- **Goal for next session:** Keep these tools active so the advanced critical thinking slides (20–24) can build on a solid base.

## Information Architecture (Slides 1–5)
- **Given-New Principle**
  - **Given = familiar context**; **New = the point you’re teaching.**
  - Readers expect *given → new* flow; reversing it forces them to guess the subject.
  - **Stress position (sentence end)** carries the heaviest cognitive weight—reserve it for the punchline.
- **Worked examples**
  - Weak: “Remote work improves job satisfaction.”  
    Strong: “Many employees feel disconnected in traditional offices. Remote work improves their job satisfaction by 40%.”
  - Fixing practice sentences always started with a context the reader already holds (e.g. drained by fluorescent lights) and ended with the new takeaway.

## Cognitive Load & Chunking (Slides 6–11)
- **7 ± 2 rule:** Working memory manages about seven pieces at once. More than that? Split the sentence.
- **Overloaded vs. skillful writing**
  - Overloaded: 13 scattered facts in one sentence.
  - Skillful: Same facts delivered across three short, orderly sentences.
- **Chunking method**
  1. List every information piece.
  2. Group related pieces (context, method, findings).
  3. Give each group its own sentence (< 7 pieces).
  4. Use transitions to keep flow smooth.
- **Practice patterns**
  - Diet-plan example → Sentence 1 = who/what, Sentence 2 = results.
  - Smartphone app example → Sentence 1 = creator + method, Sentence 2 = features.

## Critical Thinking Tools (Slides 12–15)
- **Dialectical Reasoning**
  - Structure: **Thesis** (dominant view) → **Antithesis** (legitimate opposition) → **Synthesis** (context-dependent resolution).
  - Example: “Online learning helps students learn anywhere (thesis) but hurts face-to-face connection (antithesis). Hybrid models combine strengths (synthesis).”
- **Epistemological Skepticism**
  - **Level 1 – Empirical:** What evidence exists? Are the numbers solid?
  - **Level 2 – Methodological:** How was the evidence gathered? Can we trust the design?
  - **Level 3 – Theoretical:** Which theory interprets the evidence?
  - **Level 4 – Ontological:** What assumptions about reality make the claim possible?
  - Sample analysis of “Exercise improves mental health” walked through all four levels to expose hidden assumptions.

---

## Nominalization Foundations (Slides 16–19)
- **Purpose:** Shift from “I/we did X” to “X happened/exists,” which sounds more authoritative.
- **Transformations**
  - “We studied…” → “Studies show…”
  - “Architects designed…” → “Architecture design…”
  - “We implement…” → “Implementation of…”
- **Practice cues**
  - Use prompts like “Turn ‘we studied’ into ‘studies show’” to keep the sentence professional without losing meaning.
  - Balance matters: reserve nominalization for key claims; keep verbs for energy, clarity, and concrete actions.

## Assignment – Short Writing Practice
**Purpose:** Apply the sentence-flow, chunking, and nominalization skills from Slides 1–19 in a single, short task.

### Part A – Given-New & Stress Position (≈60 words)
Rewrite the paragraph below so that every sentence begins with familiar context and ends with the punchline. Keep each sentence under seven information pieces.

> “Flexible office layouts boost productivity, but many firms ignore daylight and acoustics. Staff members are distracted, and managers question the investment. Several studies show 20% productivity gains and lower turnover when the environment is redesigned.”

### Part B – Nominalization & Chunking (≈40 words)
Write two sentences that explain why the redesign works, using at least two nominalized constructions (e.g., “implementation,” “evaluation”) and respecting the 7 ± 2 rule.

### Submission Checklist
1. Final rewritten paragraph from Part A.
2. Two nominalized sentences from Part B.
3. One bullet reflecting on which tool (Given-New, chunking, or nominalization) felt hardest to control.

*Aim for clear, reader-friendly prose—professional but still recognizably yours.*
