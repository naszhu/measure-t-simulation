[[mapping]] 
any dimensional reduction? or any structural preservation of a higher dimensional space? ?
must be a map from a SET to a point?

[[Embedding]] (roughly = mapping.?)

- X is a [[random variable]] ;;; the [[randomness]] is coming from unknown of omega, coming from sampling..??


**X IS always a deterministic function**: X: Ω → ℝ. Each ω maps to exactly one x.


- **Deterministic mapping**: X(ω) = 24 if ω = "24 dots"
- **With measurement noise**: Y = X(ω) + ε, where ε ~ Normal(0,σ²)
