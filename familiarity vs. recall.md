[[memory models]]

whether recognition is adequately modeled by a single graded variable (familiarity) or whether a qualitatively different, thresholded **content retrieval** contributes (and when).


(i) a **scalar strength comparison** (familiarity) versus (ii) a **content check** that identifies episode-specific information (recollection)?

它让你能够用数学语言严格区分 Familiarity 和 Recollection：一个是标量级的总量检测，一个是向量级的路径追踪。

The more standard separation is about **decision and access**, not space size:

- Familiarity: scalar strength signal; decision = SDT-type criterion on that scalar.
    
- Recollection: retrieval of structured information (source, position, etc.) or pattern completion
