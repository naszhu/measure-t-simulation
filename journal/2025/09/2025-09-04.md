Summary of Changes Made to Your Computer

  Files Created:

  1. /home/lea/fix-mx-scroll-snipaste.py - Python script to fix MX Anywhere
  3 scrolling in Snipaste
    - Made executable with chmod +x
    - Contains functions to apply xinput scroll wheel compatibility fixes
    - Can run as one-time fix or continuous daemon

  System Configuration Changes:

  2. xinput properties applied to MX Anywhere 3 (device ID 16):
    - Set scroll method: libinput Scroll Method Enabled 0 0 1
    - Set button mapping: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

  Files Modified:

  3. /home/lea/.config/solaar/config.json - Temporarily changed then
  reverted high-resolution scrolling setting
    - Final state: "hires-smooth-resolution": true (kept enabled)

  Root Issue Solved:

  The MX Anywhere 3's high-resolution scroll wheel sends small increment
  events (-16, -24, -32) that Snipaste doesn't recognize for zooming, unlike
   traditional mice that send standard scroll events (-120/+120). The script
   applies xinput configuration to make the scroll wheel more compatible
  with applications expecting traditional scroll behavior.

  No Packages Installed:

  - Used existing system tools: xinput, python3, solaar

  Test Status: Script has been run once. Test Snipaste zooming now to see if
   it works.
