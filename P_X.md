1. $P_X$ is a **set function** (probability measure) on $\mathcal{X}$:
- **Input**: Measurable set $B \subseteq \mathcal{X}$
- **Output**: Probability $P_X(B) = P({\omega: X(\omega) \in B})$
    - Yes, $P_X:B_𝒳$  → [0,1] is a measure (assigns probabilities to data events)
        
    - This **is** the "distribution of data" people analyze

related to [[pushforward measure]], P_X is a pushforward measure of P 


$P_X(A)=P(X^{−1}(A))$.
