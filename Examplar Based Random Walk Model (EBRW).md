each time step: [[Sampling]], [[MC sampling]], and its [[Categorical Distribution]]  

uses (stem from) concepts of [[GCM]]

The following is a [[similarity]] based sampling process (each step based on similarity sampling)  

and its [[dependent racing model]] (The LCA and decision feild theory are also dependent)

This is also a [[Monte Carlo process]]
