[[Theory of Visual Attention (TVA)]]


## [[Question]]??

- assume STM with K elemnets is of diffeernt catagories each with K elements? ==> that's called [[Perceptual Categorization]].....??? so, PC is an orginization of sensory categories into categorized (dimensional) [[STM]] ??

- Where the "[[Perception]]" happens??? 
	- encoding? real world info to pysch info? 
	- So actual flow is, [sensory] input => [[perceptual category]] (the function; the process???? (or the mapping from known to unknown????) =>  
	- is latent space real world (inital stimuli) info or psych info? 
	- [[state space - mathcal{X}]]
	- How is this related to Retrieving Effectively from Memory Model (REM) ?? all process condensed in "perception" now?
