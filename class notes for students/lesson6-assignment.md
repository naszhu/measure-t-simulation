# Assignment: Sports Camp Report

## Task

You worked as a coach at a sports camp for teenagers. Your supervisor has asked you to write a report evaluating:
1. The coaching responsibilities you undertook
2. The value of the camp for teenage participants  
3. Recommendations for improvement

**Word count:** 280-320 words

## Camp Details to Include

Your report must include specific details about:
- Participants
- Duration
- Activities
- Activities structure
- Focus

**Important:** You must also submit these details in writing separately. Write down the specific numbers, ages, timeframes, and activities you will use in your report.

## Required Structure

Your report must include these parts:

### 1. INTRODUCTION
- Purpose statement (what is this report about?)
- What will be evaluated (coaching responsibilities, camp value)
- Scope hint (recommendations will be included)

### 2. FINDINGS

**Finding 1: Coaching Responsibilities**
- **Description:** What happened? (Include specific details: numbers, ages, duration, activities, how activities were organized)
- **Evaluation:** What does this mean? What did these activities achieve?
- **Implications:** Why does this matter? What are the broader effects beyond the camp?

**Finding 2: Camp Value for Teenagers**
Develop **2-3 distinct points** about how the camp benefits teenagers. Each point must include:
- **Description:** What happened?
- **Evaluation:** What does this mean?
- **Implications:** Why does this matter?

Possible points to develop (choose 2-3 that are genuinely different):
- Social development (friends, teamwork, communication)
- Physical health (fitness, coordination, endurance)
- Academic/cognitive development (problem-solving, discipline, focus)
- Character building (confidence, perseverance, responsibility)

### 3. CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
- **Summary:** Synthesize the main findings (coaching responsibilities and camp value)
- **Recommendations:** 2-3 specific, actionable recommendations with justification
- **Final Statement:** Connect recommendations to broader goals and overall impact

✓ **Specific details** - include numbers, ages, timeframes, group sizes
✓ **Description + Evaluation + Implications** in every finding
✓ **2-3 distinct points** in Finding 2 (not just repeating the same idea)
