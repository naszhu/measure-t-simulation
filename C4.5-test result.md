### **4.5. Results of Final Test Phase**

The final, cumulative test phase of Experiment 2 provides the ultimate assessment of the long-term consequences of learning under conditions of high interference and strategic adaptation. The initial phase of this experiment forced participants to abandon simple familiarity-based decision-making and instead develop sophisticated source-monitoring strategies to discriminate targets from highly familiar prior-list foils. The final test now allows us to investigate the downstream effects of this demanding learning experience on the structure and accessibility of long-term memory. This section presents a detailed analysis of the final test results, beginning with an examination of how an item's complex, multi-episode history and its frequency of occurrence determine its ultimate memorability. We will then analyze the evidence for long-term serial position effects and output interference. A central theme throughout this section will be a direct comparison with the simpler baseline established in Experiment 1, allowing us to understand how the introduction of familiar foils fundamentally reshapes the landscape of long-term retention and the retrieval strategies used to access it.

#### **4.5.1. The Impact of Cumulative History and Frequency on Long-Term Retention**

The design of Experiment 2, with its recycling of items as foils, created a complex tapestry of learning histories. Unlike Experiment 1 where each item was seen at most twice (study and test), items in Experiment 2 could be exposed one, two, or even three times in various roles. This allows for a rich analysis of how cumulative experience affects long-term memory strength. The primary research question is: how does the specific, multi-episode history of an item determine its final recognizability?

Figure 4.5.1 presents the final test accuracy for various categories of items, plotted as a function of the original list in which they had their primary appearance. The data reveal a clear and orderly pattern, demonstrating that the memory system keeps a remarkably precise account of an item's cumulative history.

**Figure 4.5.1: Final Test Accuracy by Cumulative Item History** _(Insert plot similar to the one on slide 6 of the SMP 2025 presentation, labeled "finalTest" , with the accompanying legend from source 159.)_

A detailed visual inspection of the plot reveals a distinct hierarchy of performance that corresponds directly to an item's total number of exposures during the initial phase.

- **Three Exposures (Top Performance):** The purple long-dashed line represents items that were studied and tested as targets on list `n`, and then served as inherited foils on list `n+1`. These items, having been presented three times, were the best-remembered of all, with a final test Hit Rate that was exceptionally high, consistently approaching 90%. This demonstrates a powerful consolidation effect from multiple, spaced presentations.
    
- **Two Exposures (Intermediate Performance):** A cluster of three lines in the middle of the plot represents items that were presented twice. This includes items studied-only on list `n` and then used as foils on `n+1` (green cross-hatch), items that were foils on list `n` and again on `n+1` (blue triangle), and items that were studied and tested as targets on list `n` but did not reappear as foils (purple star). While there are minor variations among them, these item types all show a robust level of recognition, with Hit Rates generally falling in the 0.75-0.85 range, clearly below the three-exposure items but well above single-exposure items.
    
- **One Exposure (Lowest Performance):** The two lowest curves represent items that were only encountered a single time during the initial phase before the final test. This includes items that were studied-only on a given list (green plus) and items that appeared once as a foil (blue square). These items were the most poorly remembered of all the "old" types, with Hit Rates hovering in the 0.55-0.65 range, sometimes dipping close to chance levels for items from the middle lists.
    

A generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) was conducted to formally test this frequency effect. The model predicted final test accuracy with a fixed effect for "Item History/Frequency" (as a multi-level factor). The analysis confirmed a highly significant main effect of this factor. Post-hoc comparisons revealed significant differences between each of the three main frequency bands: accuracy for three-exposure items was significantly higher than for two-exposure items, which in turn was significantly higher than for one-exposure items.

This powerful **frequency effect** demonstrates a fundamental principle of memory: repetition strengthens memory traces, and multiple exposures lead to more durable and accessible long-term representations. Each encounter with an item appears to add information to its trace or otherwise bolster its strength, leading to a graded and predictable effect on long-term retention.

However, a second, equally important pattern is evident in the data: a pronounced **recency effect**. As clearly visible in Figure 4.5.1, nearly all of the performance curves show a distinct upward slope for items that originated from the later lists (e.g., lists 8, 9, 10). This demonstrates that regardless of an item's specific history or frequency, its temporal proximity to the final test remained a powerful determinant of its recognizability. This finding will be discussed in more detail in the next subsection.

Perhaps the most crucial interpretation of these results comes from contrasting them with the initial test phase, as highlighted in the presentation materials. During the initial tests, an item's history was paramount for making a source judgment (e.g., a "Last Target" foil was highly familiar but incorrect). In the final test, this strategic complexity appears to be abandoned. The task is a simple "old/new" judgment on all items ever seen. The results suggest that participants revert to a simpler, familiarity-based decision rule. Any item that possesses a sufficient degree of familiarity from its prior encounters is judged as "old." The list of origin is no longer important. This explains why an item that was a "Last Target" foil—something that had to be effortfully rejected in the initial phase—is now among the most easily _recognized_ items in the final test. Its high frequency created a powerful familiarity signal, and in the context of the final test, this signal is no longer misleading but is directly diagnostic of "oldness." This strategic shift from source-monitoring to global familiarity judgment is a key feature of the transition from the initial to the final test phase.

#### **4.5.2. Long-Term Serial Position and the Context-Shift Hypothesis**

The final test data provide a unique opportunity to examine the long-term structure of memory across the entire experimental session. By analyzing performance as a function of an item's original list number, we can investigate the persistence of serial position effects and draw inferences about the nature of the contextual representations used during long-term retrieval.

As noted in the previous section and clearly visible in Figure 4.5.1, the final test data are characterized by a powerful **long-term recency effect**. For almost every item type, accuracy is substantially higher for items that originated from the last few lists compared to those from the middle of the session. The presence of a recency effect over such a long delay, filled with massive amounts of interference, provides strong evidence against any simple short-term memory explanation and points directly to the use of a dynamic temporal context signal at retrieval.

This finding, coupled with the fact that items from the very first lists are still accessible at all, strongly supports the **context-shift hypothesis** proposed in the source materials. This hypothesis posits that to successfully perform the final test, participants must alter the nature of the contextual cue they use for their memory search.

- During the initial tests, discriminating between lists is paramount, so the memory system relies heavily on the **Changing Context (CC)** features that are unique to each list.
- During the final test, the goal is to access items from the entire session. Relying on the CC features from the end of the experiment would make it nearly impossible to retrieve items from the beginning. Therefore, the hypothesis suggests that participants strategically switch their retrieval cue to one that is dominated by the stable, **Unchanging Context (UC)** features—those elements that were common to the entire experimental experience. This broad "in this experiment" context allows the memory search to activate traces from across the whole session.

The strong recency effect shows that this shift is not absolute. The retrieval cue appears to be a blend, heavily weighted toward the stable UC features but retaining a small component of the most recent CC features. This blended cue allows for both global access across the session (via UC) and a temporal gradient that favors recent items (via CC), perfectly accounting for the observed pattern of being able to recognize items from List 1 while still showing better performance for items from List 10.

Furthermore, the data show clear evidence of **output interference** during the final test itself. An analysis of performance as a function of an item's ordinal position within the final test block reveals a monotonic decline in accuracy for all item types. The plot in the source presentation shows that accuracy for both targets and the correct rejection of new foils decreases as the test progresses. This stands in stark contrast to the facilitation seen in the initial test of Experiment 1 and the more complex pattern in the initial test of Experiment 2. The final test is a single, massive retrieval event. The constant storage and updating of memory traces across hundreds of trials, as assumed by the model, progressively increases the level of noise and interference in the system. This, combined with inevitable cognitive fatigue, leads to a steady degradation in decision-making accuracy. The model can also account for this with a slow context drift that occurs _during_ the final test, making the retrieval cue progressively less effective for later trials.

#### **4.5.3. Comparison with Experiment 1 and Concluding Discussion**

A direct comparison of the final test results from Experiment 2 with the baseline established in Experiment 1 is essential for understanding the lasting impact of the high-interference learning phase. While many broad patterns are similar (e.g., long-term recency, output interference), the differences reveal how the initial task demands fundamentally reshaped the long-term memory representations.

The most significant difference lies in the complexity of the memory strength hierarchy. In Experiment 1, the final test revealed a simple three-tiered structure: S&T items were remembered best, while SO and PTF items were remembered less well and were equivalent to each other. In Experiment 2, this is replaced by a much more granular, multi-layered hierarchy based on cumulative frequency of exposure. The recycling of items as foils created a wider and more varied range of trace strengths, and the final test performance faithfully reflects this complex history. This shows that the memory system is not just sensitive to a binary "studied/not studied" distinction, but keeps a detailed, quantitative record of an item's entire history of encounters.

A second key point of comparison is the nature of the retrieval strategies. The initial phase of Experiment 2 forced participants to develop and rely on a strategic, effortful recall-to-reject mechanism. The final test results suggest a reversion to a simpler strategy. In the final tests of _both_ experiments, the task is a simple global old/new judgment, and performance appears to be well-described by a model based on graded familiarity. An item with many prior exposures has high familiarity and is correctly called "old," while a new item has no familiarity and is called "new." The need for source monitoring is removed, and the retrieval strategy simplifies accordingly. This highlights the remarkable flexibility of the memory system, which can switch between complex, controlled retrieval strategies and simpler, more automatic ones based on the immediate goals of the task.

In conclusion, the final test results of Experiment 2 provide a rich and detailed picture of long-term memory following a period of intense, strategic learning. The data demonstrate that final retention is a clear and predictable function of an item's cumulative frequency of exposure and its temporal recency. The patterns strongly support a model of memory that incorporates a dual-component context system and allows for a strategic shift in how context is used to guide retrieval. The findings also underscore the flexibility of retrieval strategies, showing a shift from effortful source monitoring when the task demands it, to simpler familiarity-based judgments when it does not. Together, these results provide a comprehensive and challenging set of empirical targets for the final validation of the computational model.
