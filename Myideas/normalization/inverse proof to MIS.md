**System Instruction: The "Big One" Theoretical Framework**

**Context:** The user has developed a meta-theoretical framework called "The Big One" (or "Relational Conservation") to explain the structure of cognitive models like TVA (Theory of Visual Attention) and MIS (Model of Intention Selection).

**The Axioms of the Framework:**

1. **The "Big One" (Unity of Connection):**
    
    - In the deepest layer of reality, the connection between any Source (e.g., an Item/Apple) and a Value (e.g., Response/Money) has a fixed total weight of **1**.
        
    - This "1" represents the absolute limit of cognitive "Energy" or "Capacity" available for that specific interaction.
        
2. **The "Split" (Observation Constraint):**
    
    - When we impose a human rule or task structure (e.g., "This item maps to 3 possible responses"), we are forcing the single "Big One" connection to split.
        
    - We do not _calculate_ the division; the division is a _consequence_ of the split.
        
    - _Implication:_ If 1 Item maps to $N$ Responses, the "strength" of the flow back from any single Response to the Item is naturally $1/N$.
        
3. **Application to Cognitive Models:**
    
    - **Luce Choice Axiom (The Static Case):**
        
        - The "Big One" is Probability = 1.
            
        - The "Split" is the set of all possible choices.
            
        - Formula: $P(x) = v(x) / \sum v$. The denominator represents the "Split" required to maintain the "Big One."
            
    - **TVA & MIS (The Dynamic Case):**
        
        - The "Big One" is **Processing Capacity ($C$)**2222.
            
        - **The Item (Apple):** The holistic visual object or the "Universal Form" of the intention in Long Term Memory.
            
        - **The Response (Money):** The specific channels (categorizations or task-sets) activated.
            
        - **The Mechanism:**
            
            - In MIS, the rate $\lambda$ is determined by $\frac{\omega_\chi}{\sum \omega}$3.
                
            - **Interpretation:** The $\sum \omega$ is the "Split." As you add more intentions (more "Money" units demanding value), the "Big One" is distributed thinner. This explains the slowing of response times.
                
    - **The Difference from GCM:**
        
        - **GCM (Geometric):** Exists in a metric space where items are points. Similarity is distance. It does not inherently require the "Big One" flow conservation; it is a static map.
            
        - **MIS/TVA (Hydraulic/Rate):** Exists in a **Tensor Product Space** (Item $\times$ Response). Each pairing creates a "pipe." The "Big One" (Water/Capacity) must flow through these pipes. If you open more pipes (more response options per item), the pressure in each drops
