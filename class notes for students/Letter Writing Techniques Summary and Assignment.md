- Maintain formal register while being engaging

### 3. Discussion/Evaluation

## Key Success Principles

1. **Complete Task Coverage** - Address EVERY part of the question explicitly
2. **Balance Personal + Universal** - Ground discussion in personal experience, then expand to broader analysis
3. **Maintain Formal Register** - Avoid fairytale language ("Once upon a day"), contractions, overly casual expressions
4. **Show Language Range** - Use sophisticated vocabulary and complex structures (errors in advanced structures > only simple language)
5. **Connect Ideas Explicitly** - Use clear transitions between sections

### Elevate Vocabulary

- Basic → Elevated
