### 4. How “measurement” arises from this

Measure theory formalizes exactly that intuition:

- Start with incomparable sets (abstract pieces).
    
- Find an operation that embeds them in a [common background ] (ℝⁿ, or any σ-algebra).
    
- Define a function μ that assigns consistent “weights” to all subsets of that common frame.
    
- Those weights _are_ the numerical scale that didn’t exist before.
    

So “measurement” is not an absolute thing — it’s a **consistency rule** that appears once sets share a common container and comparison becomes possible.
