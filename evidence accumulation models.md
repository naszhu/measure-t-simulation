## Q: Is this a conscious or unconscious process?
[[consciousness]]

#### Unconscious Process View

**Proponents:** Schurger, Ratcliff, Smith
**Evidence accumulation:** Happens below consciousness threshold
**Consciousness:** Only aware of final decision
**Neural basis:** Subcortical, automatic


#### Conscious Control View

**Proponents:** Gold & Shadlen, Heekeren
**Evidence accumulation:** Can be consciously monitored
**Working Memory:** Holds intermediate evidence states
**Neural basis:** Prefrontal cortex, conscious access


#### Hybrid View (Most Common)

**Process:** Evidence accumulation is mostly unconscious
**Awareness:** Can become conscious with effort/attention
**Working Memory:** Interface between unconscious and [conscious]
**Control:** Top-down bias setting is conscious

**Mathematical Models Reflect This:**  
• Evidence accumulation: dx = μdt + σdW (unconscious drift-diffusion)  
• Decision threshold: θ (can be consciously set)  
• Bias parameter: z (conscious strategic control)  
• Final decision: conscious report when x(t) hits threshold
