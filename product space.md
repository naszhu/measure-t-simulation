- Elements are **pairs** $(x,y)$.

- The dimensions are **glued together**; each element carries one coordinate from each domain.

- If $X$ and $Y$ are vector spaces, the *tensor product* $X\otimes Y$ or the *Cartesian product* $X\times Y$ creates a **joint coordinate system**.

- Dimension = $\dim(X)\times\dim(Y)$.

- Typical operation: joint similarity or distance

  

$$

d((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)) = d_X(x_1,x_2) + d_Y(y_1,y_2).

$$

  

**Cognitive meaning:**

Context and content are *fused*: every memory trace is stored as one point $(c_i,f_i)$ in a joint coordinate system.
