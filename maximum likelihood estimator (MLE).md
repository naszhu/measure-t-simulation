**θ is fixed in the world**, but **you explore multiple θ values** to find the one that **best explains the data**.

> **c. So is it like a multiverse of θs?**

Yes—you're evaluating **hypothetical worlds** where θ = θ₁, θ₂, etc., and choosing the best match for observed data.
> **d. Are you assuming a distribution over θ secretly (e.g., uniform)?**

No—in MLE, you do **not** assume a prior. You just search over possible θ values. But yes, **you implicitly assume all θs are equally possible** before data, which is like an unnormalized uniform prior.
> **Is a set of θs a space?**

It can be. If you define a measure (e.g., probability density) over it, it becomes a **probability space**. Otherwise it’s just a **[parameter set]**.
