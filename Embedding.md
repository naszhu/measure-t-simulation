#### **Embedding (Topology & Geometry)**

- **Definition:** A map $f: X \to Y$ is an embedding if it is a **Homeomorphism onto its image**.
    
    - This means $f$ preserves the **Topological Structure** (nearness).
        
    - If $a$ and $b$ are close in $X$, $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ _must_ be close in $Y$.
        
- **Application in GCM:** GCM assumes the mind is an **Embedding** of stimuli into $\mathbb{R}^n$. It preserves the continuous structure (Red fades into Pink).
