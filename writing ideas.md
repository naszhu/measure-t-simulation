- For [[Model of Intention Selection (MIS)]], write about how different locus of things could lead to different result
- currently , goal representation memory actual memory modeling is lacked from the feild -> stem from here and my unification of the relationship between context and content, tell that I think MIS belongs to chich kind (product/embedding/... which kind of embedding)
-- parallel/serial & famialrity/recall & capacity limited /unlimited
q1: is there any other justifiation for non-capacity limited WM framework other than the input intention can't be all at once? (OK, maybe not, but we need to think about this) 
q2: 


- **Familiarity in MIS** (why global mathcing)→ analogous only in that total rate (Σλ) is a _global normalization_—a field-level activation, not a similarity measure.
