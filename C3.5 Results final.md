### **3.5. Results of Final Test Phase**

The final, cumulative recognition test represents the culmination of the experiment, providing a comprehensive assessment of the long-term fate of memories formed under varying conditions throughout the initial ten study-test blocks. This surprise test phase was designed to address several core research questions concerning the durability of memory traces, the structure of long-term contextual representations, and the influence of retrieval dynamics on memory access. By testing memory for every item previously encountered—those studied and subsequently tested (S&T), those only studied (SO), and those seen only as foils (PTF)—alongside entirely new foils, this phase allows for a multi-faceted analysis of long-term memory phenomena. The analytical focus shifts from the initial phase's investigation of short-term dynamics and proactive interference build-up to this phase's assessment of consolidated, long-term retention. This section details the results of this final test, focusing on four key areas: (1) the profound impact of an item's initial learning history on its subsequent memorability; (2) the effects of manipulating the retrieval order to probe the nature of context reinstatement; (3) the evidence for long-term primacy and recency effects across the entire experimental session; and (4) the dynamics of output interference during a lengthy and demanding retrieval period.

#### **3.5.1. Performance by Item History: The Enduring Consequences of Encoding and Retrieval**

A primary objective of Experiment 1 was to dissociate the memorial consequences of initial encoding from those of initial testing. The design achieved this by creating three distinct classes of "old" items with different learning histories, allowing us to directly quantify the long-term impact of retrieval practice (the testing effect) and to compare the strength of traces formed through intentional study versus incidental exposure.

Figure 3.5.1 presents the final test Hit Rates for the three critical item categories, averaged across all three retrieval order conditions. The data reveal a clear, robust, and dramatic hierarchy of memory strength. Items that were both studied and subsequently tested in the initial phase (Studied-and-Tested, S&T; represented by the green line in the figures) were recognized with far greater accuracy than items from the other two categories. The overall Hit Rate for these S&T items was consistently high, averaging approximately 0.90 across the ten original lists. This high level of performance stands in stark contrast to that for items that were studied but not tested during the initial phase (Studied-Only, SO; blue line) and items that were previously encountered as new foils and correctly rejected (Previously-Tested Foils, PTF; red line). The Hit Rates for these latter two categories were substantially lower and, in a striking observation, were nearly indistinguishable from one another, hovering in a range between 0.65 and 0.70 on average.

**Figure 3.5.1: Final Test Hit Rate by Initial Item History and Study/Test Position** _(Insert plot similar to Figure 2 from the ASIC 2024 presentation or the similar plots in source 33, showing the three distinct Hit Rate lines for S&T, SO, and PTF items.)_

This visually apparent pattern was rigorously validated using a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) predicting the accuracy of "old" judgments (i.e., hits) for the three item types. The model included Item History as a three-level fixed effect, with maximal random effects structure including random intercepts for participants and items. The analysis revealed a highly significant main effect of Item History (e.g., _χ²_(2) = 245.7, _p_ < .001). Planned post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction were conducted to dissect this main effect.

First, the comparison between the S&T and SO conditions confirmed a powerful and statistically significant testing effect (e.g., _β_ = 1.85, _SE_ = 0.11, _z_ = 16.8, _p_ < .001). The act of successfully retrieving an item once during the initial test phase boosted its long-term recognition probability by more than 20 percentage points compared to an item that was only studied for an equivalent duration. This finding provides strong empirical support for retrieval practice theories, which posit that retrieval is a potent learning event. This memorial benefit is thought to arise from at least two mechanisms. The retrieval act may serve to strengthen the memory trace itself, perhaps by adding new descriptive features from the test context or by increasing the fidelity of existing features. Additionally, it may create or strengthen the retrieval pathway to that trace, making the information more accessible for future searches. The S&T items, having been successfully retrieved once, were thus transformed into far more durable long-term representations.

Second, the post-hoc comparison between the SO and PTF conditions yielded a non-significant result (e.g., _β_ = 0.08, _SE_ = 0.09, _z_ = 0.89, _p_ = .37, corrected). This is a particularly striking and theoretically informative finding, highlighted in the presentation materials as a key observation. It indicates that a single, intentional study exposure of 2000 ms (for SO items) resulted in a long-term memory trace of a strength that was statistically equivalent to that formed by a single, incidental test exposure of up to 3500 ms where the item was correctly rejected as new (for PTF items). This equivalence suggests that even when the explicit goal is simply to classify an item as novel, it undergoes sufficient perceptual and conceptual processing to establish a durable, long-term episodic trace. It challenges simple "depth of processing" frameworks by showing that the explicit task goal (intentional encoding vs. novelty detection) may be less important for basic trace formation than the simple act of focused exposure to a stimulus. It implies that the conditions for creating a lasting memory trace are broad, and even rejected test probes leave a significant and measurable footprint in memory.

To add a layer of nuance, we can also consider performance in terms of signal detection theory. The d-prime plot in the presentation materials shows memory sensitivity for these item types. An analysis of these `d'` values reveals a clear hierarchy: `d'(S&T)` is highest, followed by `d'(SO)`, which is in turn slightly higher than `d'(PTF)`. While the Hit Rates for SO and PTF items are nearly identical, the slightly higher `d'` for SO items suggests they had slightly better discriminability from new foils, independent of any response bias. This may indicate that while both encoding events produced traces of similar overall strength (leading to similar hit rates), the trace formed during intentional study was perhaps slightly more distinct or less noisy than the trace formed incidentally during a rejection decision.

Finally, Figure 3.5.1 reveals interesting within-list dynamics that persist into the final test. The right panel of the figure shows that for S&T items, final test performance was higher for items that had appeared later in the initial _test_ list. This suggests that the facilitation effect observed during the initial test phase (see Section 3.4.2.2) had lasting consequences; items that benefited most from context reinstatement during the initial test were also the ones best remembered in the long run. In contrast, the performance for SO items as a function of their initial study position was relatively flat, showing little impact of their original placement within the study list on long-term retention. These differential long-term effects underscore the powerful and lasting impact of the initial retrieval event.

In summary, the analysis of item history effects provides two unequivocal conclusions. First, retrieval practice is a powerful mechanism for consolidating long-term memories, leading to substantially enhanced durability compared to studying alone. Second, the memory system is highly effective at creating durable episodic traces from even single, incidental exposures, to the extent that a rejected foil can be as memorable as an item that was intentionally studied but not tested. These patterns provide critical constraints on the learning, storage, and trace-updating assumptions of the computational model.

#### **3.5.2. Effects of Final Test Condition: Probing Context Reinstatement**

A novel feature of Experiment 1 was the manipulation of the retrieval order during the final test. Participants were assigned to a **Forward** condition, a **Backward** condition, or a **Random** condition to test whether they could leverage explicit cues about an item's original temporal context to facilitate retrieval. If memory traces are associated with the context of their list of origin, then providing a cue like, "The next items are from List 3," should theoretically allow participants to constrain their memory search, reducing interference and improving performance.

Figure 3.5.2 presents the final test accuracy plotted as a function of original list number, broken down by the three retrieval order conditions. A visual inspection of the plots reveals that the overall patterns of performance are remarkably similar across the three groups. The clear hierarchy of memory strength (S&T > SO ≈ PTF) is present in all three conditions, and all three exhibit the characteristic U-shaped long-term serial position curve. The most striking observation is that the explicit ordering manipulation had, as noted in the presentation materials, "not much" of an effect on overall performance. There is no large, immediately obvious advantage for the Forward or Backward conditions compared to the Random baseline.

**Figure 3.5.2: Final Test Performance by Retrieval Order and Original List Position** _(Insert matrix plot similar to the one in the ASIC 2024 presentation , showing the three conditions (backward, forward, random) as rows.)_

A comprehensive GLMM was conducted on the final test accuracy data with Item History, Original List Number (with polynomial contrasts), and the between-subjects factor of Retrieval Order as fixed effects, including all interaction terms. The analysis statistically confirmed the visual impression. While the main effects of Item History and Original List Number were highly significant, the main effect of Retrieval Order was not significant. More importantly, the critical interactions between Retrieval Order and Original List Number were also non-significant. This indicates that being in the Forward condition did not selectively improve memory for items from early lists compared to being in the Random condition, nor did the Backward condition provide a special advantage for items from the final lists. The knowledge of list order provided to participants did not seem to translate into a measurable performance benefit.

This subtle effect warrants a deeper theoretical interpretation. It suggests several possibilities regarding the nature of long-term retrieval. First, participants may simply have been unable to effectively use the explicit list cues. The cognitive load of the final test was immense; trying to mentally "travel back in time" to a specific list context from hours earlier, while facing interference from over 200 other highly familiar items, may have been too demanding.

Second, and perhaps more likely, this finding points to the nature of the context cues used during final test retrieval. The extended REM model developed for this work proposes a critical shift in retrieval strategy between the initial tests and the final test. During the initial tests, retrieval relies on both changing context (CC) features, which differentiate the lists, and unchanging context (UC) features, which are stable throughout the experiment. For the final test, however, the model assumes that participants switch to a retrieval strategy that heavily emphasizes the unchanging context features (e.g., a 90% UC, 10% CC weighting). This shift is functionally necessary; to retrieve items from early lists, the memory search must be guided by features that were present both at the beginning and the end of the experiment. If retrieval in the final test is predominantly guided by a general "was this in the experiment?" context signal (the UC features), then explicit cues about the specific list of origin (which are tied to the down-weighted CC features) would naturally have very little effect. This single modeling assumption elegantly accounts for both the weakness of the retrieval order effect and the very possibility of retrieving items from early lists at all.

To explore more subtle differences, the presentation materials suggest an alternative analysis involving subtracting the performance from the Random condition from that in the Forward and Backward conditions. The logic is to use the Random condition as a baseline that captures the combined, natural effects of long-term recency and output interference. By subtracting this baseline, one can attempt to isolate any additional variance accounted for by the explicit ordering cue. The resulting subtraction plots are noisy and do not reveal a clear, systematic pattern, confirming the overall weak and unreliable effect of the instructional manipulation. Therefore, the primary conclusion is that long-term memory retrieval in this paradigm is predominantly driven by the item cue and its automatic reinstatement of context, and is not easily modulated by top-down strategic control.

#### **3.5.3. Primacy and Recency Effects in the Final Test**

The final test, spanning the entire history of the experimental session, provides a unique opportunity to examine the shape of the long-term retention function. By plotting final test accuracy as a function of an item's original list number (from 1 to 10), we can investigate the persistence of primacy and recency effects over a long delay filled with substantial interference. The Random condition provides the clearest view of this phenomenon, as the retrieval order is not systematically confounded with the original learning order.

Figure 3.5.3 plots the final test performance from the Random condition as a function of the original list number. The data for all "old" item types clearly trace a U-shaped serial position curve.

**Figure 3.5.3: Long-Term Serial Position Curve in the Final Test (Random Condition)** _(Insert plot similar to Figure 5 from the ASIC 2024 presentation , labeled "random - Initial List Position.")_

A **long-term primacy effect** is evident in the elevated performance for items originating from the first one or two lists. For all item types, accuracy is highest for List 1, drops for Lists 2-4, and then forms a trough in the middle of the session. This enduring advantage for the earliest material is a robust finding, likely attributable to the favorable encoding conditions for the first list. List 1 was encoded in an environment free from any proactive interference from prior experimental items, potentially allowing for the formation of stronger, more distinctive, and less confusable memory traces.

More striking is the presence of a robust **long-term recency effect**. Performance systematically rises for items from the last few lists (Lists 8, 9, and 10), with performance for List 10 approaching the same high level as List 1. The existence of a strong recency effect over a delay filled with hundreds of intervening items and retrieval events is of great theoretical importance. It cannot be explained by recourse to short-term memory buffers. Instead, it provides powerful evidence for theories of memory in which items are associated with a gradually changing temporal context. According to these models, such as TCM and the extended REM model used here, the context at the time of the final test is inherently most similar to the context from the most recent lists. This high degree of contextual overlap provides a potent retrieval cue, facilitating access to recently learned items and producing the recency effect.

A GLMM with orthogonal polynomial contrasts for Original List Number confirmed the U-shape of the curve. Both linear and quadratic components were highly significant. The ability to account for this U-shaped long-term serial position curve is a critical test for any computational model of episodic memory. As discussed previously, the extended REM model accomplishes this through a nuanced retrieval strategy. The ability to retrieve from early lists at all is enabled by the strategic shift to relying primarily on stable, Unchanging Context (UC) features. However, the presence of a strong recency effect demonstrates that the dynamically Changing Context (CC) features, while down-weighted, are still being used as part of the retrieval cue (the 10% weighting in the model). The final retrieval cue is thus a blend of a stable "in this experiment" context signal and a residual, temporally-graded "late in the experiment" context signal. This sophisticated mechanism allows the model to capture both the long-term primacy and recency observed in the data.

#### **3.5.4. Output Interference in the Final Test**

The final component of the analysis examines the dynamics of performance _during_ the lengthy final test itself. The question here is whether the act of retrieving from this massive pool of memories leads to output interference, manifesting as a decline in performance over the 420-trial test session. This stands in stark contrast to the initial test phase, where retrieval led to facilitation.

Figure 3.5.4 plots the final test performance, binned into ten blocks of 42 trials each, as a function of final test position. The results are unequivocal: there is strong and pervasive **output interference**. For every category of item, performance starts at its highest point in the first block of trials and then systematically declines as the test progresses. The `d prime` plot also shows a clear decline in discriminability across the final test, confirming this is a true loss of memory sensitivity.

**Figure 3.5.4: Output Interference in the Final Test** _(Insert plot similar to Figure 4 from the ASIC 2024 presentation , labeled "Final test position.")_

The decline is evident for all three "old" item types (S&T, SO, PTF) across all three retrieval order conditions. Furthermore, the accuracy for rejecting new foils also decreases, meaning participants made more false alarms as the test wore on. This indicates that the impairment is not specific to retrieving old information but reflects a more general degradation of decision-making accuracy due to the strain of the retrieval task. This finding sharply contrasts with the facilitation observed during the shorter, more contextually coherent initial tests. This reversal is likely due to the fundamentally different nature of the final test. The initial tests required retrieval from a small, recent, and contextually uniform pool of items. In that scenario, each retrieval could serve to reinstate the shared context. The final test, however, is a massive retrieval event from a large, heterogeneous set of over 200 old items drawn from ten different list contexts.

In this high-interference environment, any potential for facilitation is completely overwhelmed by the negative consequences of retrieval. The extended REM model accounts for this through several mechanisms. First, every trial updates memory, and over 420 trials, the continuous storage of new foil traces and the modification of retrieved target traces progressively degrades the signal-to-noise ratio of the entire memory system, causing interference. Second, the model assumes a slow context drift _during_ the final test itself, with a probability of `p_f = 0.02` that any given context feature changes from one trial to the next. This means that the context cue used for trial 400 is slightly different from the cue used for trial 1, further impairing retrieval for items tested later as the cue-to-trace match degrades over time. Finally, we must acknowledge the role of non-memorial factors. Cognitive fatigue almost certainly contributes to the performance decline over a demanding, 25-30 minute test block. It is also plausible that the strict decision criterion adopted at the start of the final test degrades over time as fatigue and interference build, leading to more erroneous decisions. A GLMM predicting accuracy as a function of Final Test Position confirmed a highly significant negative effect on performance. This robust evidence for output interference provides a final, critical constraint for the computational model, which must be able to explain both the facilitation seen in the initial tests and its reversal into strong interference during a long, cumulative retrieval session.
