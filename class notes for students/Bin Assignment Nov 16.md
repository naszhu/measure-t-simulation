### **Finding 1: Coaching Responsibilities**
Rewrite this section so it contains all three components:

1. **Description**  
   - What coaching responsibilities were carried out?  
   - Include *specific details*: number of teenagers, ages, activity schedule, examples of tasks (e.g., supervision, safety management, conflict resolution).  
   - Be factual and concrete.

2. **Evaluation**  
   - What do these responsibilities show about the function or importance of coaching?  
   - Evaluate how effective these responsibilities were in maintaining safety, structure, or learning.

3. **Implications**  
   - Why does this matter for teenagers’ development, camp outcomes, or future program design?  
   - Show broader significance beyond the immediate activities.

### **Finding 2: Value of the Camp for Teenagers**
Develop **two distinct points**, each written with the same three-part structure:

For each point:

1. **Description**  
   - Describe one clear benefit the camp provided (e.g., physical health, teamwork, confidence-building).  
   - Give an example or detail from the camp activities.

2. **Evaluation**  
   - Explain why this benefit is meaningful.  
   - Assess what the camp achieved for teenagers in this area.

3. **Implications**  
   - State the broader importance: long-term skills, personal growth, or relevance beyond the camp.

**Important:**  
Your two points must be *different* from each other, not repetitions of the same idea.
