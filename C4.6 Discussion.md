### **4.6. Discussion of Experiment 2 Findings**

Experiment 2 was conceived as a direct and challenging extension of Experiment 1, designed to probe the cognitive mechanisms that support recognition memory when the simple diagnostic value of familiarity is systematically undermined. By introducing foils that were themselves highly familiar items from the immediately preceding list, the experiment created a scenario of high source ambiguity, forcing participants to move beyond novelty detection and engage in more sophisticated source monitoring. The resulting data, as detailed in the preceding sections, reveal a host of complex adaptive behaviors, including strategic criterion shifts, learned list discrimination, and the recruitment of advanced retrieval strategies. This section provides a comprehensive discussion of these findings. First, it will summarize the key results and explicitly contrast them with the baseline patterns from Experiment 1 to highlight the profound impact of the mixed-foil design. Second, it will delve into the theoretical implications of these findings, focusing on how the need to resolve source ambiguity fundamentally alters the role and utilization of context in memory. Finally, it will outline the critical considerations and challenges these results pose for the computational modeling efforts that are central to this dissertation.

#### **4.6.1. Summary of Key Results and Differences from Experiment 1**

The findings from Experiment 2 paint a picture of a memory system that is not static but is remarkably flexible and adaptive to the statistical regularities of its environment. The results stand in stark contrast to those of Experiment 1, and this divergence is itself highly informative.

**Initial Test Phase: A Shift from Automaticity to Strategic Control** The initial study-test phase of Experiment 2 revealed a set of phenomena that were qualitatively different from the baseline established in Experiment 1.

- **From Simple PI to Complex Adaptation:** In Experiment 1, the primary between-list phenomenon was a simple proactive interference effect, where Hit Rates declined while Correct Rejection (CR) rates remained high and stable. In Experiment 2, this was replaced by a far more complex pattern of strategic adaptation. We observed a **dynamic criterion shift**, evidenced by a crossover between the Hit Rate for targets and the CR rate for new foils. Participants, faced with a deluge of false alarms from familiar foils, became more conservative over time. More strikingly, we observed a robust **learning-to-discriminate** effect: participants' ability to correctly reject the highly confusing inherited foils improved steadily and substantially across the ten lists, demonstrating an active, learned ability to overcome source interference.
- **From Facilitation to Interference Resolution:** The within-list dynamics were also fundamentally altered. Experiment 1 was characterized by a surprising retrieval-based facilitation effect, where target accuracy _increased_ throughout each test block. In Experiment 2, this facilitation was attenuated or eliminated. The cognitive system, now heavily burdened by the need to adjudicate source for each item, could no longer benefit from simple context reinstatement. The test phase was transformed from a simple retrieval task into a demanding, effortful problem-solving session.
- **The Emergence of Recall-to-Reject:** The most critical new finding from the initial phase was the paradoxical performance hierarchy for inherited foils. Participants were significantly _better_ at rejecting the most familiar foils (those that were targets on the prior list) than less familiar ones. This counterintuitive result, supported by response time data showing that these impressive rejections were also the slowest, provides compelling evidence for the recruitment of a **recall-to-reject** strategy—a slow, controlled process of retrieving source information to override a misleading familiarity signal.

**Final Test Phase: The Enduring Legacy of a Complex History** The final test phase revealed the long-term consequences of this more demanding learning environment.

- **From Simple History to Graded Frequency:** In Experiment 1, the final test revealed a simple three-tiered hierarchy of memory strength (S&T > SO ≈ PTF). In Experiment 2, this was replaced by a more granular and orderly **graded frequency effect**. An item's final recognizability was a direct and monotonic function of its total number of exposures during the initial phase. Items seen three times were remembered best, followed by those seen twice, followed by those seen only once. This demonstrates that the memory system maintains a remarkably precise record of an item's cumulative history.
- **Strategic Reversion to Familiarity:** A key insight arises from comparing the initial and final test strategies. The initial phase of Experiment 2 was defined by the need to override familiarity and focus on source. In the final test, where the task reverted to a simple global "old/new" judgment, this complex strategy was abandoned. An item's high familiarity, which was misleading during the initial tests, became directly diagnostic of its "oldness" in the final test. This was evident in the fact that items that served as difficult-to-reject foils in the initial phase were among the most easily _recognized_ targets in the final test. This demonstrates a remarkable strategic flexibility, where the memory system shifts between controlled source monitoring and automatic familiarity-based judgments depending on the immediate task demands.
- **Robustness of Fundamental Effects:** Despite these differences, fundamental long-term memory effects remained robust. The final test of Experiment 2, like Experiment 1, showed a clear U-shaped serial position curve with both **long-term primacy and recency**, and strong evidence of **output interference**, with performance declining across the lengthy test block.

#### **4.6.2. Implications of Foil Manipulation for Context Utilization**

The stark differences between Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 are driven entirely by a single change: the introduction of familiar foils. This manipulation serves as a powerful lens through which to view the role of context in memory, revealing the strategic and controlled ways in which contextual information is utilized when simple familiarity is insufficient.

**The Primacy of List-Specific Context in Resolving Ambiguity** Experiment 2 fundamentally transforms the recognition task from one of item recognition to one of source recognition. The central cognitive challenge is no longer "Have I seen this item before?" but rather "Have I seen this item _in this specific context_?". The results demonstrate that participants rise to this challenge by learning to leverage list-specific context. The steady improvement in rejecting inherited foils is direct evidence that participants are learning to encode and/or retrieve the contextual features that differentiate one list from the next.

This finding brings the concept of the **Changing Context (CC)**, a core component of the proposed model, to the forefront. While the stable, Unchanging Context (UC) may be sufficient for gross familiarity judgments, it is the dynamically changing, list-specific CC features that are essential for resolving the source ambiguity inherent in Experiment 2. The learning effect observed across lists can be interpreted as a strategic shift in attention toward these CC features. Participants learn that they must bind an item not just to the general "experimental context" but to the unique temporal and associative context of the list in which it appeared.

**Recall-to-Reject as a Context Retrieval Mechanism** The discovery of the recall-to-reject strategy is arguably the most important finding of Experiment 2, and it is, at its core, a finding about context retrieval. The strategy is predicated on the ability to not just feel that an item is familiar, but to consciously _recollect the source_ of that familiarity. This act of recollection _is_ the retrieval of context. When a participant successfully rejects a "Last Target" foil, their cognitive process is an explicit act of contextual binding and discrimination: "I am retrieving a rich episodic trace for this item, and the contextual features of that trace clearly match the context of _yesterday's list_ (list N-1), not _today's list_ (list N)."

This provides a vivid illustration of the functional role of context. It is not merely a passive background associate but an active component of the memory trace that can be retrieved and inspected to inform a decision. The finding that this process is slow and effortful aligns perfectly with dual-process models of memory, which posit a fast, automatic familiarity process and a slower, more controlled recollection process. Experiment 2 creates a situation where the familiarity process is unreliable, forcing a reliance on the slower, but more accurate, recollection process. The success of this strategy depends entirely on the fidelity with which list-specific context was encoded and the participant's ability to retrieve it.

**The Flexibility of Retrieval Strategies** The contrast between the initial and final test phases highlights the remarkable flexibility of retrieval strategies. The memory system does not have a single, fixed mode of operation. In the initial tests of Experiment 2, it enters a high-control, high-effort state of source monitoring. It actively uses recollection to police the outputs of the familiarity system. In the final test, however, the task goals change. Source is no longer relevant; only global familiarity matters. In response, the system reverts to a simpler, more efficient retrieval mode that relies on the graded familiarity signal accumulated over the entire experiment.

This strategic shift has profound implications. It suggests that cognitive control mechanisms can dynamically modulate the memory retrieval process, selecting the appropriate strategy based on task demands. It also explains the apparent paradox of an item being difficult to reject on one trial and easy to recognize on another. The difficulty lies not in the item's inherent memory strength, but in the decision that must be made about it. The memory system is not just a passive repository of traces; it is an active, intelligent system that interprets those traces in the context of a specific goal.

#### **4.6.3. Further Considerations for Computational Modeling**

The rich and complex results of Experiment 2 provide a formidable challenge and a clear set of directives for the computational modeling efforts in Chapter 5. The simple REM model, even with the contextual enhancements sufficient for Experiment 1, is fundamentally incapable of capturing the strategic, adaptive phenomena observed here. To account for the findings of Experiment 2, the model must be augmented with several new, sophisticated mechanisms.

**Benchmark 1: Implementing a Dynamic Decision Criterion.** The model's decision criterion, `Theta`, can no longer be a static parameter or a simple function of test position. To capture the crossover effect between targets and new foils, the model must incorporate a mechanism for the criterion to adapt across lists. A plausible implementation would involve making the criterion at the start of list `N` a function of the false alarm rate experienced in list `N-1`. If the model makes many false alarms to inherited foils, its criterion for the next list should systematically increase, making it more conservative. This would introduce a metacognitive feedback loop into the model, allowing it to adapt its decision policy based on its own recent performance.

**Benchmark 2: A Dual-Process Architecture for Recall-to-Reject.** This is the most significant modeling challenge. The model must be extended beyond a single familiarity-based decision axis. It needs a second, parallel process that represents recollection. This could be implemented within the REM framework as follows:

- **Triggering Recollection:** The standard REM process calculates the averaged `odds` of oldness. In parallel, the model would also assess the likelihood ratio of the _single best-matching trace_ in memory. If this maximum likelihood ratio exceeds a very high "recollection threshold," it triggers a second processing stage. This naturally explains why the most familiar "Last Target" foils are most likely to trigger the process.
- **Inspecting Context:** Once triggered, this second stage involves "opening up" the retrieved trace and inspecting its feature vector—specifically, its CC (Changing Context) features.
- **Overriding the Decision:** The model would then compare the retrieved CC features to the context representations of the current list (N) and the prior list (N-1). If the retrieved context is a better match for list N-1, the model must execute a rule that overrides the high familiarity signal and outputs a "new" (reject) response. This implements the core logic of the recall-to-reject strategy.

**Benchmark 3: Modeling the Learning-to-Discriminate Effect.** The model must not only _have_ a recall-to-reject mechanism, but it must also get _better_ at using it over time. This is a complex form of procedural learning. Modeling this could take several forms. It could be a parameter change: perhaps the recollection threshold decreases with experience, making it easier to trigger the source check. Or, perhaps the weight given to the retrieved context information in the decision rule increases across lists. A more sophisticated approach would be to model an actual improvement in the efficiency of the context-retrieval process itself. Capturing this learning effect is critical for a full account of the data.

**Benchmark 4: Accounting for the Shift to a Simpler Final Test Strategy.** The model must be able to switch its mode of operation between the initial and final tests. For the initial tests, the dual-process, recall-to-reject architecture is required. For the final test, the model should revert to the simpler, familiarity-based strategy proposed for Experiment 1. This would involve "turning off" the recall-to-reject mechanism and shifting the context probe to be heavily weighted toward the UC features. The model's ability to use the same underlying memory traces but apply different retrieval and decision rules based on the phase of the experiment will be a powerful demonstration of its explanatory scope.

In conclusion, Experiment 2 successfully pushed the memory system beyond its default operating procedures, revealing a deeper layer of strategic control, contextual processing, and adaptive decision-making. The findings provide a wealth of new insights into how memory functions under ambiguity and offer a clear and challenging set of phenomena that a truly comprehensive computational model of recognition memory must address.
