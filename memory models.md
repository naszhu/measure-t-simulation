[[single-proess]] vs. [[dual-process]]

[[TCM]]

- TCM people think in terms of drift and reinstatement
- REM people think in terms of noisy encoding
- SDT people think in terms of distributions and criteria
- SIMPLE people think in terms of logarithmic distortion
- 

Measure transformations **naturally unify**:

- similarity → kernel
    
- context drift → push-forward
    
- encoding → transport
    
- attention/decay → density change
    
- recall → conditioning
    
- recognition → marginalization
    
- forgetting → divergence

- <sequential sampling models> 给决策理论带来的影响
    
- <embedding models> 给语义记忆建模带来的影响

- familiarity/global matching (SDT, SAM, TODAM)
    
- recollection/recall (context models, positional models)
    
- embedding/metric models (SIMPLE, high-dim embeddings)
    
- neural models / recurrent dynamics
