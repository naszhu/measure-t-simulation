#### PMDC Mechanism A: Proactive Control (The Strategy)

This is set at the beginning of a block to manage the upcoming "race."

|**Feature**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Targeted Accumulator(s)**|**1. Ongoing Task Accumulators** (Word/Non-word)<br><br>  <br><br>**2. PM Accumulator**|
|**Applicable Trials**|**ALL trials** within the PM block.|
|**Predicted Change (1)**|**Increase Threshold ($b$) for Ongoing Task.**<br><br>  <br><br>_Purpose: To "buy time" by forcing the ongoing task to run a longer race, increasing the chance the PM accumulator can win._|
|**Predicted Change (2)**|**Decrease Threshold ($b$) for PM Accumulator.**<br><br>  <br><br>_Purpose: To make the PM response easier to trigger with less evidence._|

#### PMDC Mechanism B: Reactive Control (The Trigger)

These changes happen rapidly _only_ when the system detects features of a PM target onscreen.

|**Feature**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Targeted Accumulator(s)**|**1. PM Accumulator**<br><br>  <br><br>**2. Ongoing Task Accumulators** (Word/Non-word)|
|**Applicable Trials**|**ONLY PM Targets** (trials containing the prospective memory cue).|
|**Predicted Change (1)**|**Increase Accumulation Rate ($v$) for PM Accumulator.**<br><br>  <br><br>_Purpose: Excitation. The specific features of the PM target provide a burst of evidence driving the PM accumulator up quickly._|
|**Predicted Change (2)**|**Decrease Accumulation Rate ($v$) for Ongoing Task.**<br><br>  <br><br>_Purpose: Feedforward Inhibition. The detection of PM features actively suppresses the processing of the ongoing task to stop it from reaching its threshold first._|
