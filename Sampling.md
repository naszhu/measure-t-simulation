### **10. Is Every Draw from a Distribution a Sampling Process?**

Yes. **Sampling** = drawing a value from a distribution, regardless of:

- Whether it's done by nature (e.g., observing ω)
    
- Or by us (e.g., Monte Carlo, posterior draws)
    
- Or mentally (as in [[auto-correlated Bayesian sampler (ABS)]])
