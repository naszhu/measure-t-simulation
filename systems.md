These thoughts came from thinking of [[Model of Intention Selection (MIS)]]


## [[infinite system]], [[infinite]]
(LTM in MIS)
**Boundary:** No clear edges or unlimited growth
**Self-Contained:** Can be "closed" mathematically [[independent]] of outside
**Capacity:** No resource constraints
**Example:** Long-term Memory (unlimited storage)


**Infinite Storage Model:**  
S = {M₁, M₂, M₃, ..., M∞} where |S| = ℵ₀  
Storage operation: Store(Mᵢ) → S ∪ {Mᵢ} ([[parallel]], [[independent]])

#### In memory framework
[[retrieval]] operation: Retrieve([[context]]) → [parallel] access to all Mᵢ  
Each Mᵢ should have independent processing rate λᵢ

- Can sample independently and in parallel
- No resource constraints on sampling mechanism
- Each sample independent of other

**[[LTM]] [[maintainance]]:**  
cost_LTM(item, ∞) = 0 (infinite duration, zero cost)

## [[finite system]], [[finite]]
(WM in MIS)
**Boundary:** Well-defined edges
**External Dependencies:** Must interact with "outside" [[dependent]] of outside
**Capacity Sharing:** Limited total resources
**Example:** Working Memory (3-7 items)


- Sampling without replacement creates dependencies
- Resource constraints emerge naturally
- Serial processing may be necessary


**[[working memory (WM)]] Maintenance:**  
cost_WM(item, t) = k·t where k > 0 (finite duration, positive cost)

The difference is cost structure, not fundamental mechanism!
