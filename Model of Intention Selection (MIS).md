about [[intention]]
This is = [[Theory of Visual Attention (TVA)]] model

[[meeting oct15]]

-> essentially is a hierarchical [[racing model]] , or say, a hierarchical [[Poisson racing model]]  

-> essentially is [[GCM]] + Time + capacity constraints

action

- {1.propositional representation + 2.motor + 2. sensor} => [action-plan] -> [intention] (a special kind of action-plan)
- propositional representation: [task]
- motor (response) + sensor (stimulus ): [task sets], 

I.e.,
* [task sets]: the set of parameters (of doing a thing) 
* [task]: task proposition itself


Essentially are a 2D model including [rate matrix]:

$\lambda(\chi _i,k_j)$, while 
- $\chi$ :intention; =(include) k1 + k2 + k3
	- $I = \{\text{all standing intentions}\}$ ; set $I$ assume to include all intentions, so sum rate =1, i think
	- intention to do different things (including the current task)
- [k]: component:
	-   $k\in K$, $K=\{k_{AD},k_{MC},k_{p}\}$: 
	- [attention, motor, proposition]
