distribution describes [[variability]]/[[spread]] of [[Sample space - Omega]], not [[structure]]!!

-- gives overall spread (vs. most informative dimension) [[TODO LIST - long term]]: relationship between these two?? gotta exist something here.

[[TODO LIST - long term]]: i still have to figure out relationships between distribution and mapping function, a little fuzzy here, of how you get a distribution, from practical flow vs. theoretical flow

[[Poisson distribution]]

Bernoulli -> Binomial -> $np\rightarrow\lambda, n\rightarrow +\infty,p\rightarrow 0$ Poisson process -> lambda $\rightarrow \infty$: normal 
Categorical -> Multinomial -> multinomial-poisson -> multinormal distribution

P: measure
P(A): probability, $A\in \Omega$
$P_X(x)$ probability $x\in X$ ..? 
p(x): density
p: can be a parameter (like that in binomial)

[[Bernoulli Distribution]], extension is [[Categorical Distribution]], the later, sum pi=1, prior p1+p2=1, draw ONE sample

[[Binomial Distribution]], extension is [[Multinomial Distribution]]
