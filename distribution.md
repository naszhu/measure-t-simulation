distribution describes [[variability]]/[[spread]] of [[Sample space - Omega]], not [[structure]]!!

-- gives overall spread (vs. most informative dimension) [[TODO LIST - long term]]: relationship between these two?? gotta exist something here.

[[TODO LIST - long term]]: i still have to figure out relationships between distribution and mapping function, a little fuzzy here, of how you get a distribution, from practical flow vs. theoretical flow

[[Poisson distribution]]



[[Bernoulli Distribution]], extension is [[Categorical Distribution]], the later, sum pi=1, prior p1+p2=1, draw ONE sample

[[Binomial Distribution]], extension is [[Multinomial Distribution]]
