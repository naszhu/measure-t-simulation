### **Direct-sum space** $X\oplus Y$
  

- Elements are **tuples** whose components stay in separate subspaces.

- The overall space is the **union of independent axes**, not a mesh of them.

Formally,

  

$$

X\oplus Y = \{x+y : x\in X,\; y\in Y\},\quad X\cap Y=\{0\}.

$$

- Dimension = $\dim(X)+\dim(Y)$.

- Inner product defined additively:

  

$$

\langle x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2\rangle =

\langle x_1,x_2\rangle_X + \langle y_1,y_2\rangle_Y.

$$

  

**Cognitive meaning:**

Context and content each live in their own coordinate system; you can *address them separately* and combine their contributions additively or multiplicatively.
