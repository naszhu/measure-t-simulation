- **The World:** A sample space of "small points" (latent features).
    
- **Encoding (The Mind's Measure):**
    
    - The mind groups points to form **Content** (Items).
        
    - The mind applies a metric to form **Relational Info**.
        
- **The Bifurcation (The Core Mechanism):**
    
    - _Path A (Familiarity):_ The system calculates the total "mass" or density of the measure near a probe. (Mathematical operation: **Integration**).
        
    - _Path B (Recall):_ The system uses the probe to navigate the manifold to a new coordinate. (Mathematical operation: **Vector Transport/Tensor Contraction**).
