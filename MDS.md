MDS is a [[structure]] form of representation of [[state space - mathcal{X}]]


This is a [[structure]] form of representation, where the axes correspond to directions in the space that explain the most **variance** or **covariance** between the features.

!! varaince& covariance? why? so all the axis are perpendicular to each other, how covaried axis are represented?

- gives most variable or most informative dimension of the [[state space - mathcal{X}]] (vs. overall spread from distribution)
