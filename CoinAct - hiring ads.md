# Postdoctoral position in Mathematical Modelling of Cognition

The Cognition, Intention, and Action (CoInAct) Research Group and Department of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Copenhagen (UCPH), Denmark, invites applications for a Postdoctoral position in mathematical modelling of cognitive processes to be filled by 1 September 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter. The position is for 2 years.  
Information about CoInAct can be found at [https://psychology.ku.dk/coinact/](https://web.archive.org/web/20250419043602/https://psychology.ku.dk/coinact/).

  
**Job content**  
The Postdoc will be part of a project entitled [**_Selection in Cognition_**](https://web.archive.org/web/20250419043602/https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/da/Forskningsaktiviteter/Bevillingsstatistik/Bevillingsoversigt/CF22_1111_Soeren-Kyllingsbaek) funded by the Carlsberg Foundation and headed by Professor Søren Kyllingsbæk and Associate Professor Thor Grünbaum. The larger project develops and tests a new theory of basic cognitive selection mechanisms by combining methods and perspectives from experimental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, mathematical modelling, and philosophy (Grünbaum, Oren, & Kyllingsbæk, 2021; Oren, Kyllingsbæk, Dupont, & Grünbaum, 2024). Applicants are asked to situate and develop their research plan within the framework of the _Selection in Cognition_ project.

The Postdoc should be a researcher with a strong background in mathematical modelling and is expected to be familiar with formals modelling frameworks such as linear ballistic accumulator models, diffusion models, biased competition models, or Bayesian models. During the employment, the candidate is expected to engage in the development of computational models, model selection, and contribute to the development of experimental paradigms. This will enable us to test and develop our theory of cognitive selection in the domains of task selection, planning, and decision making at both psychological and neurophysiological levels.

The successful candidate will be working in close collaboration with cognitive psychologists and philosophers, and other cognitive scientists, and should be interested in the development of new computational models, experimental paradigms, and theories. It is expected that the successful candidate will be present, part of the team, and partake in the activities at CoInAct on a daily basis. The Postdoc will be physically located at the Cognition and Neuropsychology research cluster [https://psychology.ku.dk/research/research_clusters/cognition-and-clinical-neuropsychology/](https://web.archive.org/web/20250419043602/https://psychology.ku.dk/research/research_clusters/cognition-and-clinical-neuropsychology/), at the Department of Psychology, University of Copenhagen.

  
**Qualification requirements**  
The candidate must have obtained a PhD degree in mathematics, statistics, psychology, cognitive science, engineering, or related fields.

Emphasis will be placed on the following:

- Research qualifications, which will be assessed in relation to the period of active research, the degree of originality, and academic output.
- Experience in one or more of the following:
    - Computational models of cognition.
    - Advanced statistical analyses of behavioural data;
    - Designing and conducting psychological experiments;
- The applicant’s scientific record (publications in top journals within modelling and experimental and cognitive psychology), academic breadth and depth, rigor, thoroughness, and accuracy, as well as academic relevance in relation to the job description.
- Participation in networks – national and international.
- Previous experience with interdisciplinary collaboration and research.
- Good interpersonal skills.
- Excellent skills in English, written and spoken.
