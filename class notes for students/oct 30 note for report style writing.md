## <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">Key Principles from Lesson 4</span>

### <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">1. Professional Objectivity</span>
- **No personal opinions**: Avoid "I think," "I believe," "in my opinion"
- **Use third-person assessment**: "Analysis suggests," "The evidence indicates," "Evaluation reveals"
- **Professional tone**: Write as if presenting findings to a committee or organization

### <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">2. Description + Evaluation Framework</span>
Every professional report needs to:
- **Describe objectively** (what the situation is)
- **Evaluate analytically** (what it means)
- **Recommend strategically** (what should happen)

**KEY POINT**: Description alone = Limited. Description + Evaluation + Implications = Sophisticated

### <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">3. Multiple Points (Not Just One!)</span>
- Exam rubrics note that making only ONE recommendation or point is a limitation
- **For professional reports, develop at least 2-3 distinct points in depth**
- Each point should be genuinely different, not just the same idea repeated

### <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">4. Professional Report Structure</span>

**INTRODUCTION** — Purpose and scope, context

**FINDINGS** — What you discovered (description), what it means (evaluation), evidence

**CONCLUSIONS** — Synthesis of key points, broader implications, strategic recommendations

## <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">Essential Language Patterns</span>

**For Describing:**
- "The service operates..." / "Current data indicates..." / "Analysis reveals..."

**For Evaluating:**
- "The significance extends beyond..." / "Analysis reveals that..." / "The program's impact extended beyond..."

**For Recommending:**
- "Analysis suggests that [action] would..." / "Strategic considerations include..." / "Recommendations include..."

## <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</span>

**Being Too Personal**
- Bad: "I love this because I use it every day"
- Good: "The service serves approximately 1,150 daily passengers, including significant proportions of elderly residents (25%)..."

**Being Too Vague**
- Bad: "A good transport system is important because it helps people"
- Good: "A comprehensive transport system enables spatial integration by connecting residential zones with employment, education, and service hubs..."

**Making Only One Point**
- Bad: "The service is important because people need it. Also, it's needed because people use it."
- Good: Develop 2-3 distinct points (e.g., Economic impact, Social impact, Transport system role)

## <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">Limited vs. Sophisticated Approach</span>

| Element | Limited Approach | Sophisticated Approach |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| Language | Simple, personal | Professional, objective |
| Evidence | General statements | Specific data and patterns |
| Analysis | Basic cause-effect | Complex relationships, implications |
| Tone | Personal opinion ("I think") | Third-person assessment |
| Depth | Surface description | Evaluates significance and context |

---

## <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">Self-Check Framework</span>

Before submitting your report, check:

✓ **Structure**: Clear introduction, findings, and conclusions?
✓ **Description**: Specific details with evidence?
✓ **Evaluation**: Explain significance, not just describe?
✓ **Tone**: Professional and objective language?
✓ **Depth**: Analyze beyond surface level?
✓ **Sophistication**: Precise terminology and nuanced understanding?
✓ **Multiple Points**: 2-3 distinct points/recommendations?

## <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">Key Takeaways</span>

1. <span style="color: #d32f2f; font-weight: bold;">**Description + Evaluation + Implications**: Never just describe—always explain why it matters and what the implications are.</span>

2. <span style="color: #d32f2f; font-weight: bold;">**2-3 Distinct Points**: Develop multiple distinct points/recommendations. Making only one point is a limitation in exam rubrics.</span>

3. <span style="color: #d32f2f; font-weight: bold;">**Professional Objectivity**: Use third-person assessment language ("Analysis suggests...") and avoid personal opinions ("I think...").</span>

# HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT

---

## <span style="color: #1976d2; font-weight: bold;">Task: Sports Camp Report</span>

**Write short a complete report responding to this question:**

> You have recently worked as a volunteer, coaching teenagers at a sports camp designed to encourage young people to take up new sports. The organisers have asked you to write a report for the website. You should briefly describe your responsibilities as a coach for two different sports. You should also evaluate how valuable the sports camp was for teenagers overall and recommend how it could be improved in the future.

**INTRODUCTION:**

Professional reports begin by establishing purpose and scope. Use third-person language ("This report evaluates..." / "The assessment examines...") and set the context for what you're investigating. State what you'll cover without using personal opinions.

---

**FINDINGS:**

*Coaching Responsibilities (Two Sports):*

Describe your responsibilities objectively with specific details—age groups, numbers, skills taught, time commitment. Use professional language: "My responsibilities involved..." / "The role required..." / "I was tasked with coaching..." Show what made each sport different or challenging.

[Note: For this practice assignment, we omit the second findings point (evaluation of camp value). However, remember that in CPE reports, you need to develop 2-3 distinct points in depth—making only one point is a limitation.]

---

**CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS:**

Provide strategic recommendations using professional language ("Implementation of..." / "Establishment of..." / "Analysis suggests..."). Show you understand implications, not just list changes. Conclude with broader significance or strategic thinking.
