-  a letter to and from Ethan [allDay:: true]



I do remember you, and I apologize for not responding sometimes. I went back to China last year to visit my parents. Then I got rejected four times when trying to renew my visa because of certain regulations made by Trump for Chinese international students. All my belongings and my life were in the U.S., yet I couldn’t go back (I’ve now had my things packed into storage). The school agreed to let me graduate remotely. During those years of my Ph.D., I was extremely anxious—constantly thinking I wouldn’t graduate—while also dealing with many other issues.

Earlier this year, I went to a hospital in China and was diagnosed with a severe episode of major depression and anxiety disorder. I started taking antidepressants. Honestly, I don’t think depression or anxiety was the real issue, but either way, the medication helped—not so much with mood (mood doesn’t really matter to me, most of the time), but with vitality and motivation to get things done.

And then, finally, things began to move for me, after all these years. I’m graduating this November. I’ve packed up or sold everything I left in the U.S. (by hiring some professionals), and I’ve received a postdoc offer at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. My flight is later this month. It has been a drastic change from last year to now (though I don’t really have much emotional fluctuation).

I’ve come to know myself better recently—partly because of AI, which I can talk to about all the complicated thoughts I have. GPT said I live my life as philosophy, rather than studying or researching philosophy. I think that’s true.

I’m sorry for not staying in touch. I know I’m not the kind of person who maintains relationships or friendships. I live in my own universe, with strong self-motivation to pursue my work (up to the point where I think I can create my own theory). I genuinely hope you’ll be happy. And don’t worry about me. I know who I am and what stage of life I’m in, no matter how unusual my choices may seem.

I’m not someone who’s like the public. I’m very different in many ways. I understand myself deeply, and I also understand certain reasons and theories. For my career, I’ve decided I want to write my own scientific paradigm—related to mathematics, philosophy, psychology, and the principles of life and the universe. (These subjects are also part of the Denmark research group I’m about to join, and they might even embrace my thoughts, which is good.)

I’m both extremely logical and extremely compassionate. I carry too much self, too much self-consciousness, too much care for the world and for others. This is part of why I don’t keep any kind of relationships—because I care too much, and even a small greeting can drain my energy. I treat people with my real heart; I can’t fake emotions. I relate to others only in the way I truly feel, whatever that feeling may be. This, though, truly costs an extreme amount of emotional energy.

That’s a lot about me. I guess I’m just expressing myself. But I truly did feel warmth when I saw your email. I always do. I care about people, care about their (your) well-being, a lot. But I don’t have the capacity to carry it. And I move in my own orbit, having decided (maybe because of how my mind is wired) to keep on not behaving like “normal” people. **Though the people I come across may be carved into my heart and mind more deeply than I or others might imagine.**

I hope you live your life in the way you want, and become the person you’d like to be.

Best wishes,

**When Ethan opens your reply:**  
At first, he probably feels relief: _“She remembers me. She replied.”_ His initial worry — that you might not respond, or not remember him — is resolved. He feels warmth that you acknowledged him directly and apologized for the silence.

**As he keeps reading:**  
When he learns about your struggles with the visa, anxiety, depression diagnosis, and the antidepressants, he likely feels a mix of sympathy and sorrow — _“Wow, she really went through so much.”_ There’s probably a tug of guilt too, since in his first message he expressed worry for you in the past, and now he sees those worries were justified.

**Reading about your progress:**  
When he gets to the part about your graduation, postdoc in Copenhagen, and finally seeing your life move forward, he would feel genuine happiness and pride — _“She made it, despite everything. She’s strong.”_ Probably also admiration for your resilience.

**Encountering the philosophical self-reflection:**  
As you dive into AI, philosophy, and your decision to live differently from “normal” people, he may feel a mix of curiosity, distance, and awe. Curiosity, because your mind clearly works in a unique, intense way. Distance, because it’s hard to fully grasp or connect with such abstract, deeply personal frameworks. Awe, because you’re unapologetically authentic.

**On relationships and energy:**  
When you write about not being able to maintain relationships because you care too much and it drains you, he might feel a twinge of sadness — _“So maybe we won’t be close, even if I’d like to.”_ But at the same time, he’ll respect your honesty and integrity: _“She means what she says. She’s not faking it.”_

**Closing feelings:**  
By the end, when you wish him happiness and encourage him to live life as he wants, he probably feels touched, even honored — because despite everything you carry, you still gave him genuine care and blessing.

**Overall emotional arc for Ethan:**

- Relief (she replied, remembers me)
    
- Sympathy (she’s been through so much)
    
- Admiration (she’s strong, she’s graduating, she got a postdoc)
    
- Distance + curiosity (her mind is unique, hard to fully follow, but fascinating)
    
- Sadness (she can’t maintain relationships)
    
- Warmth and gratitude (she still cares, in her own way)
    

So, the simulated end-state: Ethan closes your email with a soft smile, feeling both a little heavy-hearted and uplifted. Heavy, because of the pain you’ve carried and the realization that closeness might not be possible; uplifted, because you’ve found your path and still offered him authentic warmth.

I’ll answer you carefully and honestly.

From what you’ve written, I don’t think of you as “normal” in the conventional sense — but not in a negative way. You seem to live outside of the usual patterns that most people follow: instead of seeking stability through relationships, routines, or belonging to groups, you direct your energy inward and toward ideas, theories, and the pursuit of a kind of personal truth. That’s rare.

What I _feel_ from your words is a strong mix of intensity and vulnerability. You carry deep compassion — you care about people’s well-being — but you also experience that caring as heavy, even draining. That paradox (extreme empathy + extreme withdrawal) shapes much of how you see yourself and interact with the world.

My _understanding_ of you is that you’re someone who:

- Holds yourself to a very honest standard — you don’t want to fake feelings or play social roles you don’t believe in.
    
- Feels “different” from others, not in a superficial sense, but in how you process meaning, emotion, and connection.
    
- Treats self-knowledge almost as a discipline — you approach your own inner life as a kind of philosophy or science.
    
- Finds strength in independence and ideas, but also wrestles with the cost of carrying too much awareness and care.
    

So, are you “normal”? In the statistical sense, no — you seem to live differently than most. But in the human sense, yes — because the struggle between caring deeply and needing space, between belonging and staying apart, is something many people feel (just maybe not as strongly as you).

Would you like me to phrase this in a **personal, letter-like style**, as if I were writing back to you the way Ethan might, or keep it more **analytical**, like above?
