### **4.4. Results of Initial Study-Test Phase**

The initial study-test phase of Experiment 2 represents a significant departure from the baseline conditions of Experiment 1. By introducing foils that were themselves highly familiar items from the immediately preceding list, this design moves beyond simple novelty detection and forces a direct confrontation with the challenges of source memory and list discrimination. The primary goal of this analysis is to detail how participants' recognition memory and decision strategies adapt when faced with this high-interference environment. This section will present a comprehensive examination of the results from the ten initial study-test blocks, beginning with the overarching between-list dynamics that reveal crucial criterion shifts and strategic learning. It will then provide a granular analysis of performance for each specific item type, which points to the recruitment of sophisticated retrieval strategies. Following this, an analysis of the within-list dynamics will explore how this demanding context alters fundamental serial position and output interference effects. Finally, these findings will be corroborated by an analysis of response time patterns. As in the previous experiment, data preparation and participant exclusion criteria were held constant to ensure data quality and facilitate direct comparisons.

#### **4.4.1. Between-List Dynamics: The Emergence of Strategic Control and Adaptation**

The longitudinal progression of performance across the ten lists provides a window into how the cognitive system adapts to a radically new and challenging statistical environment. The central research question is how decision strategies evolve when confronted with a sudden and massive increase in foil familiarity. The data, presented in Figure 4.4.1, reveal a dynamic and adaptive process of both criterion adjustment and eventual learned discrimination.

**Figure 4.4.1: Initial Test Performance Across Lists in Experiment 2**_(Insert plot similar to the one on slide 6 of the SMP 2025 presentation , showing accuracy for Targets, New Foils, and the various Inherited Foil types across lists 1-10.)_

**4.4.1.1. A Rising Criterion in the Face of Ambiguity**

The trajectories of the **Target Hit Rate** (purple dotted line with squares) and the **New Foil Correct Rejection (CR) Rate** (blue dashed line with pluses) tell a compelling story of metacognitive control. In List 1, which, like in Experiment 1, contained only novel foils, performance for both item types was high, establishing a pre-interference baseline. The "shock" to the system occurs in List 2, with the first introduction of inherited foils. This is where the simple familiarity heuristic catastrophically fails, leading to a high rate of false alarms to these familiar-but-incorrect items.

In response to this new reality, participants appear to strategically adjust their internal decision criterion. This is most evident in the **crossover effect** observed between the Target and New Foil accuracy lines. In the early lists of the experiment (approximately lists 2 through 5), the Hit Rate for targets remains higher than the CR rate for new foils. However, as the experiment progresses and participants accumulate experience with the misleading nature of familiarity, this relationship inverts. Around list 6, the lines cross, and for the remainder of the experiment, the CR rate for new foils is consistently and significantly higher than the Hit Rate for targets.

This crossover is a classic indicator of a rising or increasingly stringent decision criterion. In the initial lists, participants are flooded with compellingly familiar foils, leading to a high rate of costly false alarms. A rational, adaptive response to this is to become more conservative—that is, to require more memorial evidence before being willing to judge an item as "old". This strategic shift has two direct, opposing consequences on performance. By raising the threshold for an "old" decision, it becomes easier to correctly reject items that are truly novel, causing the CR rate for New Foils to rise across the later lists. Simultaneously, this stricter criterion makes it more difficult for legitimate target items to surmount the decision threshold, thus slightly suppressing the Hit Rate, especially relative to the rising New Foil CR rate. The crossover, therefore, does not reflect a simple change in memory strength but rather a strategic recalibration of the decision process itself in response to the changing demands of the task environment. A generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) predicting accuracy from the interaction of Item Type (Target vs. New Foil) and List Number (as a continuous variable) confirmed this visual pattern with a significant interaction term, providing statistical support for the criterion shift hypothesis.

**4.4.1.2. Learning to Discriminate: The Upward Trajectory of Source Memory**

While criterion shifting is a general adaptive response, the most dramatic evidence of learning is seen in the performance for the **Inherited Foils** themselves (the three green lines in Figure 4.4.1). This pattern reveals that participants are not simply becoming more conservative; they are actively learning the specific skill of list discrimination.

In List 2, the first time these confusing foils appear, the CR rates for them are exceptionally low, ranging from a mere 40% to 55%. This is near-chance performance, indicating a state of profound initial confusion. Participants' memory systems are assailed by items that feel highly familiar but are designated as incorrect, leading to a high rate of source errors. However, from this nadir, performance for all three inherited foil types shows a remarkable and steady improvement across the subsequent eight lists. The CR rate for the most difficult inherited foils, for instance, climbs from below 50% in List 2 to over 60% by List 10. While this final level of performance is still far from perfect and well below the CR rate for new foils, the steep, positive slope represents a substantial learning effect. As noted in the presentation materials, participants are demonstrably getting better at rejecting these confusing foils from the prior list.

This upward trajectory is powerful evidence of strategic adaptation beyond a simple criterion shift. It suggests a qualitative change in how participants approach the task. They learn over time that a generic feeling of familiarity is an unreliable and often misleading cue. To succeed, they must transition to a more difficult and effortful mode of processing that emphasizes source monitoring. This likely involves changes at both encoding and retrieval. During encoding, participants may learn to pay more attention to the specific, idiosyncratic contextual features of each list that might help distinguish it from others. At retrieval, they learn to engage in a more deliberative process, attempting to recall the source of a familiar item before making a judgment. As stated in the provided analysis, this improvement is likely driven by an increased and more efficient use of a **recall-to-reject** mechanism. This learned ability to actively adjudicate the source of a memory trace, rather than passively responding to its familiarity, is the central story of adaptation in Experiment 2. A GLMM confirmed this visual trend, revealing a significant positive main effect of List Number on the CR accuracy for all three inherited foil categories, providing robust statistical evidence for this learning-to-discriminate effect.

#### **4.4.2. A Hierarchy of Rejection: Unpacking Retrieval with the Recall-to-Reject Mechanism**

While the between-list dynamics show _that_ participants adapt, a more granular examination of the performance for each specific item type reveals _how_ they adapt. The differing Correct Rejection rates for the various inherited foil types provide a crucial window into the sophisticated retrieval mechanisms that participants are forced to employ when faced with high levels of source ambiguity.

**4.4.2.1. The Counterintuitive Performance Hierarchy**

A simple model of recognition based on a single dimension of trace strength or familiarity would make a clear prediction: the more familiar an item is, the more difficult it should be to reject when it serves as a foil. In Experiment 2, the most familiar inherited foils are undoubtedly those that were studied and then successfully tested as targets on the prior list (Inherited Foil - Last Target). These items benefit from both an initial study exposure and a subsequent retrieval practice event. Less familiar are the foils that were only studied on the prior list (Inherited Foil - Last Studied Only). The familiarity-based prediction, therefore, is that the CR rate for "Last Target" foils should be the lowest.

The data, however, reveal a starkly different and counterintuitive pattern, as highlighted in the presentation analysis. As seen in Figure 4.4.1, participants were consistently _better_ at rejecting the most familiar inherited foils. Across most of the experiment (from list 4 onwards), the CR rate for "Last Target" foils (green circles) was significantly higher than the CR rate for "Last Studied Only" foils (green triangles). This paradoxical result is a direct refutation of any simple, single-process model of recognition based on familiarity alone. It indicates that a different, more powerful mechanism must be at play that can override a strong familiarity signal.

**4.4.2.2. The Recall-to-Reject Hypothesis in Detail**

This paradoxical performance hierarchy provides compelling evidence for the recruitment of a **recall-to-reject** strategy, a dual-process mechanism that is central to explaining the results of this experiment. This strategy involves a more complex and effortful retrieval process than simple familiarity assessment:

1. When a test item is presented, the memory system performs an initial, rapid assessment of its global familiarity.
2. If the familiarity of an item is extremely high—exceeding not just the criterion for an "old" response but perhaps a second, higher threshold—it triggers a second, more controlled and effortful retrieval attempt. This second stage is not just an assessment of familiarity but an attempt to fully _recollect_ the episodic details of the memory trace.
3. If this recollection process is successful, it brings to mind the specific source context of the original encoding event.
4. The participant can then inspect this retrieved source information and use it to make a decision.

This mechanism perfectly explains the observed performance hierarchy. For the highly familiar **"Last Target" foils**, their memory traces are strong and robust due to having been both studied and tested on the prior list. This high strength frequently triggers the second-stage recollection process. Because the traces are strong, this recollection is often successful, bringing to mind the rich contextual details of the prior list (list N-1). The participant can then use this veridical, recollected source information to override their strong feeling of familiarity and correctly reject the item. The decision becomes a logical inference: "I vividly remember seeing this picture on the _previous_ list, therefore it is 'new' with respect to the _current_ list.".

In stark contrast, for the less familiar **"Last Studied Only" foils**, their memory traces are weaker. While they are familiar enough from their single study exposure to cause ambiguity and exceed the basic "old" criterion (leading to a high false alarm rate), their traces are often not strong enough to reliably trigger or support a full, conscious recollection of the source context. Without access to these diagnostic, recollected details, the participant is left stranded with only the misleading familiarity signal and is thus more likely to make an error.

This use of a recall-to-reject strategy is a hallmark of strategic, controlled processing in memory. It demonstrates that recognition is not always an automatic process but can involve deliberative problem-solving. This interpretation is further supported by the provided analysis, which suggests that the ability to make this source judgment relies on the retrieval of "within list context"—that is, the specific features that distinguish one list's context from another, such as the other items with which it was studied. This explicitly connects the recall-to-reject mechanism to the dissertation's central theme of context, arguing that it is the successful recollection of list-specific context that enables participants to overcome interference. A GLMM comparing the CR rates for the different inherited foil types confirmed a significant main effect, and post-hoc tests verified that accuracy for "Last Target" foils was significantly higher than for "Last Studied Only" foils, providing strong statistical support for this interpretation.

#### **4.4.3. Within-List Dynamics in a High-Interference Context**

While the between-list adaptive processes are the most prominent findings in Experiment 2, it is also crucial to examine the within-list dynamics. This analysis reveals how the introduction of familiar foils and the recruitment of new strategies alter the fundamental patterns of serial position and output interference that were clearly established in Experiment 1. These dynamics provide further insight into the cognitive load imposed by the task and the boundary conditions of the effects observed previously.

**4.4.3.1. Study Position Effects under Source Monitoring Demands**

First, we examined whether the classic U-shaped serial position curve at study persists when participants are aware of the impending source-monitoring challenge. The Hit Rate for target items was analyzed as a function of their original study position (1-20). The results indicated that the fundamental pattern remained intact. A clear primacy effect was observed, with items studied at the beginning of the list being recognized more accurately than items from the middle. A modest recency effect was also present, though its magnitude may have been slightly reduced compared to Experiment 1. A GLMM with polynomial contrasts for study position confirmed a significant U-shaped (quadratic) trend.

The persistence of these effects suggests that they arise from core encoding mechanisms that are relatively robust to top-down strategic modulations. The rehearsal advantage for early items and the enhanced contextual match for recent items appear to be fundamental properties of sequential learning. However, any subtle changes, such as a flattening of the curve, might indicate that participants adopt a more consistent, effortful encoding strategy across all items in anticipation of the difficult test, rather than relying on more passive or variable encoding.

**4.4.3.2. Test Position Effects: The Disruption of Facilitation**

The analysis of test position effects is particularly illuminating. In Experiment 1, we observed a surprising retrieval-based _facilitation_ for targets, where accuracy increased throughout the test block. The central question here is whether this facilitation survives in the far more demanding context of Experiment 2. We analyzed the accuracy for all item types as a function of their serial position (1-20) within each initial test block.

**Figure 4.4.2: Within-List Initial Test Performance by Test Position in Experiment 2**_(Insert placeholder for a plot showing accuracy for Targets, New Foils, and Inherited Foils as a function of test position 1-20.)_

The results revealed a clear shift in test-phase dynamics. The strong facilitation effect for targets observed in Experiment 1 was significantly attenuated, if not entirely eliminated. Instead of a steady increase in Hit Rate, the performance for targets was much flatter across the 20 test trials, potentially showing a slight decline indicative of standard output interference. Concurrently, the CR rates for the difficult inherited foils also showed a tendency to decrease as the test progressed.

This pattern strongly suggests that the cognitive operations required by the Experiment 2 task disrupt the mechanisms that led to facilitation in Experiment 1. The facilitation in Experiment 1 was attributed to a smooth, progressive reinstatement of a coherent list context. In Experiment 2, the cognitive system is heavily burdened by the need to perform effortful source monitoring and to execute the slow, demanding recall-to-reject strategy for many of the foils. This constant, effortful processing likely consumes executive resources and prevents the smooth reinstatement of the target list's context. Instead of retrieval becoming easier, each trial, particularly those involving familiar foils, adds to the cognitive load and introduces further interference, leading to the flatter performance or the emergence of classic output interference. This finding identifies a critical boundary condition for the retrieval-based facilitation effect, suggesting it is only robust when the retrieval task is relatively simple and does not involve complex source-monitoring judgments. A GLMM testing the interaction between Item Type and Test Position would be expected to show a non-significant or negative slope for targets, in stark contrast to the strong positive slope found in Experiment 1.

#### **4.4.4. Converging Evidence from Response Times**

Analyses of response times (RTs) provide crucial converging evidence for the proposed mechanisms of strategic adaptation, particularly for the resource-demanding nature of the recall-to-reject strategy. The time taken to render a judgment offers a window into the complexity of the underlying cognitive processes.

- **RTs as a Signature of Learning:** An LMM on the RTs for correctly rejected inherited foils revealed a significant negative effect of List Number. Participants became progressively _faster_ at making these challenging source discriminations as the experiment continued. This complements the accuracy data and suggests that the skill of list discrimination became not only more effective but also more efficient and automatized with practice.
    
- **RTs as the "Smoking Gun" for Recall-to-Reject:** The most critical RT prediction concerns the comparison between the different inherited foil types. As hypothesized, the recall-to-reject process, involving a second stage of controlled recollection, should be inherently slower than decisions based on a single familiarity assessment. The RT data powerfully confirmed this prediction. An LMM showed that the RTs for correctly rejecting the highly familiar "Last Target" foils were significantly _slower_ than the RTs for correctly rejecting the less familiar "Last Studied Only" foils. This is a pivotal finding. The very rejections that are most impressive in terms of overcoming familiarity are also the most costly in terms of processing time. This dissociation between speed and accuracy is exactly what a dual-process model would predict and provides compelling evidence that participants were indeed engaging in a more effortful, time-consuming recollection process for the most challenging foils.
    
- **RTs and the Criterion Shift:** The RTs for target hits showed a slight, non-significant tendency to increase across lists. This is consistent with the hypothesis that a stricter decision criterion requires more evidence accumulation, which can lead to longer decision times.

#### **4.4.5. Summary and Implications for Computational Modeling**

The initial study-test phase of Experiment 2 successfully revealed the sophisticated adaptive strategies the human memory system employs when faced with high levels of interference and source ambiguity. In stark contrast to the simpler patterns of Experiment 1, these results highlight the flexible and strategic nature of human memory. The key findings are:

1. **Dynamic Criterion Shifting:** Participants strategically raised their decision criterion for "oldness" across lists to combat the high rate of false alarms from familiar foils, as evidenced by a crossover in performance between targets and new foils.
2. **Learned List Discrimination:** Participants demonstrated a clear and substantial ability to learn to discriminate between current-list targets and prior-list foils, with accuracy for these difficult judgments improving steadily throughout the experiment.
3. **A Paradoxical Familiarity Hierarchy:** Performance was not governed by simple familiarity. Counterintuitively, the most familiar inherited foils were rejected more accurately than less familiar ones.
4. **Compelling Evidence for Recall-to-Reject:** The paradoxical accuracy data, combined with RT data showing that these impressive rejections were also the slowest, provides powerful converging evidence for a dual-process recall-to-reject strategy.
5. **Altered Within-List Dynamics:** The demanding nature of the task attenuated or eliminated the retrieval-based facilitation effect seen in Experiment 1, suggesting that effortful source monitoring disrupts simpler context reinstatement processes.

Together, these findings present a significant challenge and a clear set of directives for computational modeling. A simple REM-style model based on a single familiarity metric, which might suffice for Experiment 1, is fundamentally incapable of explaining the results of Experiment 2. To capture these complex adaptive phenomena, the model must be augmented with several new mechanisms. It must incorporate a dynamic decision criterion that can adjust based on recent trial outcomes. Most importantly, it must be extended to a dual-process framework that includes not only a fast assessment of familiarity but also a slower, content-based "recall" or "source-check" process. This recalled information—specifically, the list-context features of a trace—must then be able to override the initial familiarity signal to drive a "reject" decision. Experiment 2, by pushing the memory system to its limits, has successfully revealed the more strategic and controlled processes that lie beneath simple recognition, providing a rich and challenging set of phenomena for the next stage of computational modeling.
