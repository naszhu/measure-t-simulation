  abstract = {Recognition memory accuracy is harmed by prior testing (a.k.a., output interference [OI]; Tulving \& Arbuckle, 1966). In several experiments, we interpolated various tasks between recognition test trials. The stimuli and the tasks were more similar (lexical decision [LD] of words and nonwords) or less similar (gender identification of male and female faces) to the stimuli and task used in recognition testing. Not only did the similarity between the interpolated and recognition tasks not affect recognition accuracy but performance of the interpolated task caused no interference in subsequent recognition testing. Only the addition of recognition trials caused OI. When we presented a block of LD trials or gender identification trials before the recognition test, a decrease in accuracy was observed in the subsequent recognition tests. These results suggest a distinction between temporal context and task context, such that recognition memory performance is determined by the salience of the context cues, and the use of temporal context cues is associated with OI.},

Selective retrieval of some studied information can revive the nonretrieved information and bring recall levels back to the levels shortly after study. Strikingly, we found that time-dependent forgetting after selective retrieval mimics time-dependent forgetting after study, which implies that the revival of the forgotten memories is lasting and caused by a reset of the recall process. In the real world, retrieval of encoded episodes is often selective and is often time-lagged, like in educational settings or in eyewitness testimony situations. Our findings suggest that selective retrieval can improve people's memory in such situations.           ,              Humans remember less and less of what was encoded as more and more time passes. Selective retrieval can interrupt such time-dependent forgetting, enhancing recall not only of the retrieved but also of the nonretrieved information. The recall enhancement has been attributed to context retrieval and the idea that selective retrieval reactivates the retrieved item's temporal context during study, which can facilitate recall of other items that had a similar context at study. However, it is unclear whether context retrieval induces a transient discontinuity in the stream of temporal context only, or a more permanent updating of context that would entail a lasting interruption of time-dependent forgetting. In three experiments, we analyzed time-dependent forgetting of encoded information right after study and after time-lagged selective retrieval. Selective retrieval boosted recall of the nonretrieved information up to the levels observed directly after study. Intriguingly, it also created a restart of time-dependent forgetting that made forgetting after retrieval indistinguishable from forgetting after study and thus induced a reset of the recall process. The results suggest that selective retrieval can revive forgotten memories and cause lasting recall enhancement, effects likely mediated by context retrieval and a permanent updating of temporal context.},

Recent theoretical models have converged on a particular account, based on transient associations between independent item and context representations. In the present article, the authors present an alternative model, according to which sequence information is encoded through sustained patterns of activation within a recurrent neural network architecture. As demonstrated through a series of computer simulations, the model provides a parsimonious account for numerous benchmark characteristics of immediate serial recall, including data that have been considered to preclude the application of recurrent neural networks in this domain. Unlike most competing accounts, the model deals naturally with findings concerning the role of background knowledge in serial recall and makes contact with relevant neuroscientific data. Furthermore, the model gives rise to numerous testable predictions that differentiate it from competing theories. Taken together, the results presented indicate that recurrent neural networks may offer a useful framework for understanding short-term memory for serial order.},

Here, the many similarities between serial and free recall are noted, and it is suggested that differences may result not from the use of different mechanisms but from task demands and the involvement of rehearsal processes. Rehearsal has not previously been accommodated by temporal distinctiveness models because of their simplifying assumption that items occupy point locations along a temporal dimension in memory. Here, it is suggested that use of representations that acknowledge items' temporal extension allows the scale-similar temporal distinctiveness approach to account for several additional phenomena that lie outside the scope of other models.},

Mathematically, the theory is tractable, and it specifies the computations necessary for selection. The theory is applied to extant findings from a broad range of experimental paradigms. The findings include effects of object integrality in selective report, number and spatial position of targets in divided-attention paradigms, selection criterion and number of distracters in focused-attention paradigms, delay of selection cue in partial report, and consistent practice in search. On the whole, the quantitative fits are encouraging.},

We evaluate this model using output interference, a decline in accuracy as a function of the words presented during test. Output interference is consistent with models that allow interference from words other than the test word, when each test produces a memory trace, and hence a source of interference. Models positing interference solely from prior contexts of the test word itself predict no effect of items presented during test, without added assumptions. We find robust output interference effects in recognition memory. The effect remains intact after a long delay, when study-test lag is held constant, when feedback is provided, and when the test is yes/no or forced choice. These results are consistent with, and support the view that interference in recognition memory is due in part to interference from words other than the current test word.},

However, most theories to date have not been applied to the accompanying pattern of response latencies, thus ignoring a rich and highly diagnostic aspect of performance. This article explores and tests the error latency predictions of four alternative mechanisms for the representation of serial order. Data from three experiments show that latency is a negative function of transposition displacement, such that list items that are reported too soon (ahead of their correct serial position) are recalled more slowly than items that are reported too late. We show by simulation that these data rule out three of the four representational mechanisms. The data support the notion that serial order is represented by a primacy gradient that is accompanied by suppression of recalled items.},

Along with the additional assumption that information within a cluster is serially ordered, the model accounts for a number of phenomena from short-term memory (with a focus on serial recall) and episodic memory (with a focus on free recall). The model also accounts for the effects of aging on serial and free recall, apparent temporal isolation effects in short- and long-term memory, and the relation between individual differences in working memory and episodic memory performance.},

  abstract = {We formalize and provide tests of a set of logical-rule models for predicting perceptual classification response times (RTs) and choice probabilities. The models are developed by synthesizing mentalarchitecture, random-walk, and decision-bound approaches. According to the models, people make independent decisions about the locations of stimuli along a set of component dimensions. Those independent decisions are then combined via logical rules to determine the overall categorization response. The time course of the independent decisions is modeled via random-walk processes operating along individual dimensions. Alternative mental architectures are used as mechanisms for combining the independent decisions to implement the logical rules. We derive fundamental qualitative contrasts for distinguishing among the predictions of the rule models and major alternative models of classification RT. We also use the models to predict detailed RT distribution data associated with individual stimuli in tasks of speeded perceptual classification.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that letter identity and letter position are not integral perceptual dimensions (e.g., jugde primes judge in word-recognition experiments). Most comprehensive computational models of visual word recognition (e.g., the interactive activation model, J. L. McClelland \& D. E. Rumelhart, 1981, and its successors) assume that the position of each letter within a word is perfectly encoded. Thus, these models are unable to explain the presence of effects of letter transposition (trial--trail), letter migration (beard--bread), repeated letters (moose--mouse), or subset/superset effects (faulty--faculty). The authors extend R. Ratcliff's (1981) theory of order relations for encoding of letter positions and show that the model can successfully deal with these effects. The basic assumption is that letters in the visual stimulus have distributions over positions so that the representation of one letter will extend into adjacent letter positions. To test the model, the authors conducted a series of forced-choice perceptual identification experiments. The overlap model produced very good fits to the empirical data, and even a simplified 2-parameter model was capable of producing fits for 104 observed data points with a correlation coefficient of .91.},

In Experiment 1, participants were presented with lists of between 2 and 12 words for IFR at a fast, medium, or slow rate, with and without articulatory suppression (AS). The tendency to initiate output with the first item for short lists (a) did not change greatly when presentation rate was increased from a medium to a fast rate under normal conditions, (b) was reduced but not eliminated by AS, and (c) was maintained at slower rates when rehearsal was allowed but decreased at slower rates when rehearsal was prevented. In Experiment 2, the overt rehearsal methodology was used, and the tendency to initiate output with the first item for short lists was present even in the absence of overt rehearsal. Experiment 3 re-examined IFR under normal encoding conditions and replicated the main findings from the normal encoding conditions of Experiment 1 while using the presentation rates and list lengths of Experiment 2. We argue that rehearsal is not strictly necessary for the tendency to initiate recall with the first item under normal conditions, but rehearsal nevertheless contributes to this effect at slower rates.},

We examined whether the failure of individuals to allocate sufficient attentional resources to nonfocal PM tasks can be linked to the response demands inherent in PM paradigms that require the PM task to race for response selection with the speeded ongoing task. In three experiments, participants performed a lexical decision task while being required to make a separate PM response to a specific word (focal), an exemplar of a category (nonfocal), or a syllable (nonfocal). We manipulated the earliest time participants could make task responses by presenting a tone at varying onsets (0--1,600 ms) following stimulus presentation. Improvements in focal PM and nonfocal PM were observed at response delays as brief as 200 ms and 400 ms, respectively. Nonfocal PM accuracy was comparable to focal PM accuracy at delays of 600 ms and 1,600 ms for categorical targets and syllable targets, respectively. Delaying task responses freed the resource-demanding processing operations used on the ongoing task for use on the nonfocal PM task, increasing the probability that the nonfocal PM features of ongoing task stimuli were adequately assessed prior to the ongoing task response.},

  abstract = {Experts act without thinking because their skill is hierarchical. A single conscious thought automatically produces a series of lower-level actions without top-down monitoring. This article presents a theory that explains how automatic control is possible in skilled typing, where thinking of a word automatically produces a rapid series of keystrokes. The theory assumes that keystrokes are selected by a context retrieval process that matches the current context to stored contexts and retrieves the key associated with the best match. The current context is generated by the typist's own actions. It represents the goal (``type DOG'') and the motor commands for the keys struck so far. Top-down control is necessary to start typing. It sets the goal in the current context, which initiates the retrieval and updating processes, which continue without top-down control until the word is finished. The theory explains phenomena of hierarchical control in skilled typing, including differential loads on higher and lower levels of processing, the importance of words, and poor explicit knowledge of key locations and finger-to-key mappings. The theory is evaluated by fitting it to error corpora from 24 skilled typists and predicting error probabilities, magnitudes, and patterns. Some of the fits are quite good. The theory has implications beyond typing. It argues that control can be automatic and shows how it is possible. The theory extends to other sequential skills, like texting or playing music. It provides new insights into mechanisms of serial order in typing, speaking, and serial recall.},

  abstract = {From the beginning of research on serial memory, chaining theories and position coding theories have been pitted against each other. The central question is whether items are associated with each other or with a set of position codes that are independent of the items. Around the turn of this century, the debate focused on serial recall tasks and patterns of error data that chaining models could not accommodate. Consequently, theories based on other ideas flourished and position coding models became prominent. We present an analysis of a retrieved context model that integrates chains and position codes. Under some parameter values, it produces classic chains. Under most parameter values, it produces context representations that contain information sufficient to specify the position codes in position coding theories. We suggest three ways to extract position codes from context representations and show the codes they produce are mathematically equivalent to the codes in position coding models. The extracted position codes can be substituted for the position codes in position coding models and run through their machinery to mimic their predictions exactly. We suggest that chains, position codes, and retrieved contexts may reflect different strategies for extracting desired information from a common set of memory representations, and we emphasize the value of considering item-dependent context representations that are made from fading traces of past items encoded or retrieved.},

  abstract = {This article asks whether serial order phenomena in perception, memory, and action are manifestations of a single underlying serial order process. The question is addressed empirically in two experiments that compare performance in whole report tasks that tap perception, serial recall tasks that tap memory, and copy typing tasks that tap action, using the same materials and participants. The data show similar effects across tasks that differ in magnitude, which is consistent with a single process operating under different constraints. The question is addressed theoretically by developing a Context Retrieval and Updating (CRU) theory of serial order, fitting it to the data from the two experiments, and generating predictions for 7 different summary measures of performance: list accuracy, serial position effects, transposition gradients, contiguity effects, error magnitudes, error types, and error ratios. Versions of the model that allowed sensitivity in perception and memory to decrease with serial position fit the data best and produced reasonably accurate predictions for everything but error ratios. Together, the theoretical and empirical results suggest a positive answer to the question: Serial order in perception, memory, and action may be governed by the same underlying mechanism.},

  abstract = {Exemplar-retrieval models such as the exemplar-based random-walk (EBRW) model (Nosofsky \& Palmeri, 1997) have provided good accounts of response-time (RT) and choice-probability data in a wide variety of categorization paradigms. In this chapter I review recent work showing that the model also accounts accurately for RT and choiceprobability data in a wide variety of probe-recognition short-term memory-search paradigms. According to the model, observers store items from study lists as individual exemplars in memory. When a test probe is presented, it causes the exemplars to be retrieved. The exemplars that are most readily retrieved are those that are highly similar to the test probe and that have the greatest memory strengths. The retrieved exemplars drive a familiarity-based evidence-accumulation process that determines the speed and accuracy of old-new recognition decisions. The model accounts for effects of memoryset size, old-new status of test probe, and study-test lag; effects of the detailed similarity structure of the memory set; and the role of the history of previously experienced memory sets on performance. Applications of the model reveal a quantitative law of how memory strength varies with the retention interval. In addition, the model provides a unified account of how probe recognition operates in cases involving short and long study lists. Furthermore, it provides an account of the classic distinction between controlled versus automatic processing depending on the types of memory-search practice in which observers engage. In short, the model brings together and extends prior research and theory on categorization, attention and automaticity, short- and long-term memory, and evidence-accumulation models of choice RT to move the field closer to a unified account of diverse forms of memory search.},

  abstract = {Participants gave recognition judgments for short lists of pictures of everyday objects. Pictures in a given list were an equal mixture of three types that varied according to the way they were used as targets and foils earlier in the same session. Under consistent-mapping (CM), targets and foils never switch roles; under varied-mapping (VM), targets and foils switch roles randomly across trials; whereas all-new (AN) items are novel on each trial of the experiment. Past research has shown that markedly enhanced performance occurs in CM conditions, leading to conclusions that item-response learning takes place in CM, perhaps automatically. However, almost all past research has compared CM, VM, and AN performance in between-blocks designs in which participants may adopt different cognitive strategies and criterion settings across the conditions. The present mixed-list design holds constant the strategy and criterion settings that are used for CM, VM, and AN items, and produced patterns of performance dramatically different than those observed in pure-list control conditions. We develop an extended version of an exemplar-based random-walk model of probe recognition to account for the major qualitative effects in the data. The data and the modeling provide evidence for strong item-response learning for CM foils but weak item-response learning for CM targets. We consider possible explanations for these effects in our General Discussion.},

  author = {Osth, Adam F and Hurlstone, Mark J},
  abstract = {Logan (2021) presented an impressive unification of serial order tasks including whole report, typing, and serial recall in the form of the context retrieval and updating (CRU) model. Despite the wide breadth of the model's coverage, its reliance on encoding and retrieving context representations that consist of the previous items may prevent it from being able to address a number of critical benchmark findings in the serial order literature that have shaped and constrained existing theories. In this commentary, we highlight three major challenges that motivated the development of a rival class of models of serial order, namely positional models. These challenges include the mixed-list phonological similarity effect, the protrusion effect, and interposition errors in temporal grouping. Simulations indicated that CRU can address the mixed-list phonological similarity effect if phonological confusions can occur during its output stage, suggesting that the serial position curves from this paradigm do not rule out models that rely on interitem associations, as has been previously been suggested. The other two challenges are more consequential for the model's representations, and simulations indicated the model was not able to provide a complete account of them. We highlight and discuss how revisions to CRU's representations or retrieval mechanisms can address these phenomena and emphasize that a fruitful direction forward would be to either incorporate positional representations or approximate them with its existing representations.},
