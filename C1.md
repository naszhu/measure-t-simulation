# **The Role of Dynamic Context in Episodic Memory: Theoretical Foundations and Computational Perspectives**

## **Chapter 1: Introduction**

Episodic memory, the remarkable capacity to recollect personal past experiences, stands as a cornerstone of human cognition. Its profound influence on our sense of self and our ability to navigate the complexities of daily life underscores the importance of understanding its intricate mechanisms. Central to the functioning of episodic memory is the concept of context – the rich tapestry of environmental, temporal, and internal cues that accompany our experiences. While intuitively significant, the precise role of context, particularly its dynamic nature, presents considerable challenges for empirical investigation and theoretical modeling. This chapter lays the groundwork for a detailed exploration of context within episodic memory. It begins by establishing the fundamental importance of episodic memory, then delves into the multifaceted concept of context, its critical role in memory storage and retrieval, and the inherent difficulties in its study. Subsequently, an overview of computational modeling approaches in memory research is provided, with a brief introduction to the Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) model, which serves as a foundation for the research presented in this dissertation. Finally, the chapter outlines the specific research aims and objectives, culminating in a roadmap for the dissertation's structure. The overarching goal is to bridge the understanding of _why_ context is crucial to _how_ its dynamic interplay with memory can be systematically investigated and computationally modeled.

### **1.1. The Importance of Episodic Memory**

Episodic memory refers to a sophisticated neurocognitive system that enables human beings to consciously remember past experiences.1 First conceptualized by Tulving (1972), this system allows individuals to engage in "mental time travel," re-experiencing specific events from their personal past, complete with details about what occurred, where it happened, and when it transpired.3 This capacity goes beyond merely knowing facts about the world; it involves the ability to learn, store, and retrieve information about unique personal occurrences that shape daily life.2

The significance of episodic memory is multifaceted and profound. Primarily, these memories are integral to the formation and maintenance of an individual's personal sense of identity.4 By providing a continuous narrative of personal history, episodic recollections contribute to a cohesive understanding of oneself and one's journey through life.4 The ability to recall these unique personal experiences is the very mechanism through which this sense of identity and personal history is constructed and preserved. Consequently, impairments in episodic memory often lead to significant disruptions in an individual's self-concept and their ability to relate their present self to their past.

Furthermore, the "mental time travel" afforded by episodic memory is not solely confined to revisiting the past. This capacity is also thought to underpin our ability to project ourselves into the future, enabling us to plan, make decisions, and anticipate outcomes based on lessons learned from previous encounters.6 The neural and cognitive machinery that allows for the vivid reliving of past events can be flexibly adapted to simulate future scenarios by recombining elements of prior experiences, thus linking episodic memory to a broader suite of higher-order cognitive functions that extend beyond simple recall. The definition of episodic memory itself has evolved from an initial focus on materials and tasks to encompass these deeper aspects, including the self, subjective time, and autonoetic consciousness—the awareness of oneself as a continuous entity across time.7 This evolution highlights the depth and centrality of episodic memory in human cognition, justifying the intensive research efforts dedicated to unraveling its complexities.

### **1.2. The Concept of Context in Memory Research**

In the study of memory, "context" refers to the constellation of surrounding information—be it environmental, internal, or temporal—that is present during the encoding (learning) and retrieval (remembering) of an event.8 It is not merely a passive backdrop but an active component that becomes integrated with the memory target itself. The phenomenon of context-dependent memory, where recall is improved when the context present at encoding and retrieval are the same, underscores this active role.8 This effect has been demonstrated for various types of contextual information, including external environmental cues, such as the underwater or land-based settings in the classic Godden and Baddeley (1975) study 10, as well as internal states, such as mood or physiological arousal.11 Context serves to set up expectations, organize information, and can act as a powerful cue for triggering the retrieval of memories containing that contextual information.9 Understanding the pervasive influence of context is foundational for developing comprehensive theories of memory.

#### **1.2.1. Defining Context vs. Content**

A critical distinction in memory research is that between "content" and "context".9 Content typically refers to the specific information or item that is the target of memory—the "what" of an experience, such as a particular word, image, or factual detail. In contrast, context encompasses the broader situational, environmental, temporal, or internal milieu in which that content is embedded—the "where," "when," "how," and the internal state associated with the encoding of that content.9 For instance, in a study list, the words themselves are content, while the room in which they are studied, the time of day, or the participant's mood constitute elements of context.

This distinction is not merely semantic; it has significant implications for both theoretical understanding and computational modeling. Many computational models of memory, including the REM-based model detailed later 23, explicitly differentiate between features representing content and features representing context. In the model described in 23, "content features C" are intrinsically tied to the studied items, whereas "changing context features CC_ℓ" and "unchanging context features UC" represent the broader encoding environment, which can vary or remain stable across different learning episodes.

While conceptually distinct, context and content are often deeply intertwined in memory. The purpose of memory, in large part, is to guide current and future behavior based on previous experiences, and in many situations, the context dictates the relevance, meaning, or appropriate behavioral response to the content.9 For example, memory for "item-location pairings" is not just memory for an item and a location separately, but for their specific conjunction.9 The content "fire" elicits vastly different interpretations and actions depending on whether the context is a cozy fireplace or a dry forest. This interdependence implies that content often derives its full significance from its associated context.

However, the practical operationalization of this distinction can present challenges. What one researcher might define as "content" (e.g., a background image presented alongside a target word in a paired-associate learning task) another might categorize as "context." This definitional flexibility, as noted by researchers 9, underscores a fundamental difficulty in memory research: the challenge of isolating and defining precisely what constitutes context in any given situation. This ambiguity necessitates clear operational definitions within research designs, an approach exemplified by the explicit categorization of features in computational models like the one described in.23

#### **1.2.2. The Dynamic Nature of Context**

Context is not a static entity; rather, it is inherently dynamic, continuously changing over time—a phenomenon often referred to as "contextual drift".13 Furthermore, memories themselves are not immutable but can be updated or altered long after their initial acquisition, particularly when they are reactivated. This process of memory updating is often context-dependent. Research has shown that when memories are reactivated, for instance by returning to the original learning environment, they can enter a labile state, allowing new information encountered in that same context to be incorporated into the existing memory trace.13 This highlights the role of context in memory reconsolidation.

The dynamic nature of context encompasses shifts in environmental surroundings, internal physiological and emotional states, and the mere passage of time.14 Computational models aiming for psychological plausibility must account for this dynamism. For example, the model outlined in 23 explicitly incorporates mechanisms for contextual change, such as the parameter `δ_list`, which governs the probability of context features changing between different study lists, and `δ_drift`, which represents the probability of context features drifting between the study phase and the test phase within a single list.

Understanding context as a dynamic construct is crucial for explaining several key memory phenomena, including forgetting (which can occur due to a mismatch between the current context and the context at encoding) and the updating of memories with new, relevant information. Models that treat context as a fixed, unchanging set of features would fail to capture these fundamental aspects of real-world memory function.

The dynamic nature of context and the process of context-dependent updating appear to serve an adaptive function, allowing memories to remain current and relevant by being modified in light of new, related experiences.13 If an individual learns new information that refines or corrects an older memory, and this new learning occurs in the original context, the memory system can integrate this update. However, this same malleability also renders memories susceptible to distortion if the new information encountered is misleading or inaccurate. This has significant implications, for example, in the domain of eyewitness testimony, where revisiting the scene of a crime (the original context) could lead to the incorporation of post-event misinformation into the witness's memory of the event.

The observation that memories are "automatically reactivated when subjects return to an original learning context" 13 suggests that computational models need to incorporate mechanisms whereby context acts not just as a passive set of features associated with a memory trace, but as an active retrieval cue capable of triggering the lability and potential modification of stored traces. The parameter `δ_reinstate` in the 23 model, which specifies the probability of reinstating the study context after each test trial, hints at this active role. This reinstatement can be conceptualized as a mechanism that refreshes the contextual state, preparing the system for subsequent encoding or retrieval attempts based on a context that is more aligned with the original learning episode.

### **1.3. The Role of Context in Memory Storage and Retrieval**

Context plays a fundamental role in both the encoding of new memories and their subsequent retrieval. The encoding specificity principle, famously articulated by Tulving and Thomson (1973), posits that the likelihood of retrieving a memory is significantly enhanced when the cues present at retrieval match those that were present during the initial encoding phase.3 Context, in its various forms (environmental, temporal, internal state), serves as a powerful and often pervasive set of such cues.

During storage, contextual information is not merely appended to memory traces but is often intricately woven into the representation of the experience itself.8 This means that the memory for an event includes not only the core content but also the surrounding circumstances of its acquisition. Consequently, at the time of retrieval, the reinstatement of the original encoding context—either by physically returning to the same environment or by mentally reconstructing it—can dramatically improve recall accuracy and completeness.3 This phenomenon is robust and has been demonstrated in diverse settings, from laboratory experiments involving word lists 3 to real-world scenarios such as eyewitness recall, where mentally reinstating the context of a crime can help witnesses remember more details.17 The classic Godden and Baddeley (1975) experiment with scuba divers, who showed better recall when the learning and testing environments (underwater vs. on land) matched, remains a compelling illustration of this principle.3

The integral role of context in memory formation and access directly informs the design of computational models. Such models must simulate these encoding dynamics, where context features are stored as part of the memory trace, and retrieval dynamics, where the match between the current (or reinstated) context and the stored context influences the probability and accuracy of recall. The model described in 23, for instance, explicitly includes context features (both changing and unchanging) as part of the stored memory traces and utilizes these features in the decision process during recognition tests.

The potency of context as a retrieval cue can, however, vary depending on its characteristics. For instance, research indicates that contexts that are less frequently encountered or more distinctive (e.g., "low-frequency locations") tend to yield a stronger context-dependent memory effect; memories encoded in such distinctive contexts benefit more from a match between encoding and retrieval contexts compared to memories encoded in highly familiar or common contexts.18 This suggests that the novelty or distinctiveness of a context can modulate its effectiveness as a retrieval cue. Highly familiar contexts, being associated with a multitude of different episodes, may offer less specific cuing for any single episode, thereby diminishing their unique contribution to retrieval. This observation has implications for computational modeling, potentially suggesting that context features associated with novel or distinctive contexts should carry greater weight or be less susceptible to interference from other memory traces.

The metaphor of context as a "scaffold" to which experiences are bound offers a useful way to conceptualize its organizational role in memory.13 According to this view, particularly emphasized for spatial context, experiences are attached to this contextual framework during encoding. Retrieval then involves reactivating this scaffold. If the contextual scaffold present at retrieval differs significantly from the one active during encoding, access to the experiences bound to that original scaffold becomes more difficult, potentially leading to retrieval failure or even the formation of a new, separate memory trace if new learning occurs in a substantially different context.13 This aligns with models like that in 23, where context features (CC and UC) form an integral part of the memory representation.

Furthermore, the memory system appears to be flexible in its use of retrieval cues. When strong contextual cues are unavailable or when the context has changed significantly, individuals may shift their reliance to other available cues, such as semantic relationships between items or the internal organization of the material.3 This suggests an adaptive retrieval system where the weighting of different types of cues (e.g., contextual, semantic, item-specific) can dynamically adjust based on their perceived reliability and diagnosticity in a given retrieval situation. Computational models aiming for comprehensive accounts of memory retrieval may need to incorporate such adaptive cue-weighting mechanisms to capture this flexibility.

### **1.4. Challenges in Studying Context**

Despite its acknowledged importance, the study of context in memory research is fraught with significant challenges related to its operationalization, isolation, and control in experimental settings.9 Context is, by its nature, pervasive and multifaceted. It encompasses not only the external physical environment but also a wide array of internal factors, including an individual's mood, physiological state, attentional focus, and even the cognitive operations engaged by the task itself.9 This complexity makes it exceedingly difficult to precisely define what constitutes "context" in any given experimental situation and to isolate its effects from those of the target items or from more general low-level perceptual features.9

One major hurdle is the difficulty of achieving "process purity".9 Observed behavioral effects that are attributed to "context" might often be confounded by other cognitive processes, such as shifts in attention, changes in retrieval strategies, or item-specific processing. For example, a change in the physical room between study and test might indeed alter the external context, but it could also inadvertently influence a participant's arousal level or prompt them to adopt a different approach to the memory task. Disentangling these intertwined influences requires exceptionally careful experimental design and, increasingly, the use of computational modeling to simulate and differentiate the potential contributions of these various factors.

The inherent difficulty in experimentally isolating and manipulating all relevant aspects of context in human studies serves as a strong impetus for the use of computational models. Such models allow researchers to define contextual parameters with precision 23 and to systematically explore their impact on memory processes in a way that would be impossible to achieve with such fine-grained control in human experiments.21 The complexities encountered in attempting to justify specific modeling choices for contextual dynamics, as articulated in the reflections on model development 23 (e.g., "how are large and increasing changes in CC justified?"), are a direct consequence of these broader empirical challenges.

Furthermore, individual differences add another layer of complexity to the study of context. Factors such as life adversity, trait anxiety, and acute stress can significantly modulate how contextual information is processed and how it influences memory formation and retrieval.20 This suggests that "context" is not a monolithic entity experienced identically by all individuals; rather, its processing and impact are filtered through stable personality traits and transient psychological states. This observation points towards a frontier for memory research where models might need to incorporate parameters that can be tuned to reflect these individual differences, thereby moving towards more person-specific predictions of memory performance. The pervasive and often subtle nature of context makes it a challenging but essential variable to understand in the quest for a comprehensive theory of episodic memory.

### **1.5. Overview of Computational Models of Memory (Briefly introducing REM)**

Computational modeling has become an indispensable tool in cognitive psychology and neuroscience for advancing our understanding of the latent processes underlying complex cognitive functions such as episodic memory.24 These models aim to provide explicit, mechanistic explanations for a wide range of memory phenomena by formalizing theories into mathematical equations or algorithms.22 Typically, computational models of memory specify three interacting components: the _representations_ of information in memory, the _associations_ formed between these representations, and the _dynamics_ of encoding, storage, and retrieval processes.24 Several influential models have been developed, including the Temporal Context Model (TCM), the Bind Cue Decide Model of Episodic Memory (BCDMEM), the Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model, and the Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) model, each offering unique insights into the architecture and functioning of episodic memory.24

The Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) model, first proposed by Shiffrin and Steyvers (1997), is a prominent theory of recognition memory.25 A core assumption of REM is that experiences are stored as separate episodic images, or traces, in memory. Each trace consists of a vector of feature values representing the different aspects of the studied item and its encoding context.25 Crucially, the encoding process is assumed to be probabilistic and error-prone, meaning that each stored image is an incomplete and potentially noisy copy of the actual event.25 When a test item is presented, the model calculates the likelihood that this item matches the stored traces. Recognition decisions are then typically based on an assessment of the probability that the test item is "old" (i.e., previously studied) by comparing it to the contents of memory, often via a likelihood ratio computation.25

The feature-based representational framework of REM naturally accommodates the inclusion of contextual information. Contextual features can be incorporated into the memory trace alongside item-specific features, as exemplified in the detailed REM-based model outlined in 23, which includes distinct sets of features for item content (C), changing context (CC_ℓ), and unchanging context (UC). The "incomplete and error-prone copying" mechanism inherent in REM provides a plausible account for why contextual encoding might not always be perfect, leading to variations in the strength and accessibility of context-dependent memories.

The REM framework has proven to be adaptable, with various extensions and variants developed to account for a broader range of empirical findings. For instance, D-REM was developed to incorporate dynamic decision-making processes and predict response times, which the original REM model did not explicitly address.27 Other versions, such as REM.3, have been used to model phenomena like list-strength and spacing effects.26 The model described in 23 can be viewed as another such specialized extension, tailored to investigate the complex and dynamic effects of context on recognition memory. This evolution of the REM framework underscores its flexibility and its capacity to serve as a foundation for developing more nuanced theories of memory, particularly concerning the role of context. The ongoing development of REM and its variants signifies a research program dedicated to refining its core principles to tackle new empirical questions and to enhance its explanatory power for the diverse ways context shapes our recollections.

### **1.6. Research Aims and Objectives of the Dissertation**

The preceding sections have highlighted the critical role of episodic memory, the pervasive influence of context on its operations, the challenges inherent in studying context, and the utility of computational modeling in addressing these complexities. Building upon this foundation, this dissertation aims to deepen our understanding of how dynamic contextual factors influence recognition memory, both empirically and theoretically. The primary research questions guiding this work revolve around the mechanisms by which context is represented, updated, and utilized during memory encoding and retrieval, particularly within a computational framework grounded in the Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) model.

#### **1.6.1. Investigating context through recognition paradigms**

The first principal objective of this dissertation is to systematically investigate how different facets of context influence recognition memory performance. This will involve employing well-established recognition memory paradigms, including item recognition and potentially associative recognition tasks.28 In these paradigms, manipulations of contextual variables—such as the nature and degree of context change between study and test, the type of contextual information available (e.g., temporal, environmental), and the characteristics of foil items 30—will be used to probe their impact on memory accuracy and potentially other measures like response latency and confidence.

The empirical investigations will be designed to generate data that can directly inform and constrain the development and validation of the computational model proposed in the second objective. For instance, experiments might explore how varying the rate of contextual drift 23 or the magnitude of context change between learning lists 23 affects hit rates and false alarm rates. The role of "confusing foils," as discussed in the modeling explorations 23, suggests that manipulating foil similarity in conjunction with contextual changes will be a particularly fruitful avenue for investigation. The data gathered from these studies will provide crucial benchmarks for assessing the model's ability to capture the nuances of context-dependent recognition.

#### **1.6.2. Developing and testing an extended computational model (REM-based)**

The second principal objective is to develop, refine, and test an extended computational model, based on the REM framework, that can more comprehensively account for the dynamic effects of context in recognition memory. This objective directly addresses the need for formal theories that can explain how context is encoded, how its representation changes over time and across experiences, and how it influences decision-making processes during recognition. The model detailed in 23, with its explicit mechanisms for representing changing (CC) and unchanging (UC) context features, context drift (`δ_drift`), list-wise context change (`δ_list`), context reinstatement (`δ_reinstate`), and context-sensitive decision criteria (`τ`, `Θ_j`), serves as a foundational example of such a model.

The research will involve implementing this model (or a refined version thereof) and rigorously testing its ability to simulate both existing findings from the literature and new empirical data generated from the studies outlined in Objective 1.6.1. This will entail fitting the model to experimental data, examining its parameter sensitivities, and evaluating its capacity to predict performance across various contextual manipulations. A key focus will be on addressing the challenges and questions raised during preliminary modeling considerations 23, such as providing empirically grounded justifications for assumptions about how different types of context (e.g., CC vs. UC) are utilized across different phases of a memory experiment, including initial learning lists and subsequent final tests.

These two objectives are designed to be synergistic. The empirical investigations will provide the necessary data to constrain the theoretical development of the computational model, ensuring its psychological plausibility. In turn, the computational model will serve as a formal instantiation of theoretical ideas, generating precise, testable predictions that can guide further empirical inquiry. This iterative cycle of empirical investigation and computational modeling is a hallmark of progress in cognitive science and is central to the approach taken in this dissertation.

The dissertation aims to address specific gaps in the current understanding of context and memory. For example, a key area of investigation will be how computational models can effectively account for the simultaneous influence of both stable, long-term contextual factors 23 and more transient, dynamic contextual changes (represented by CC features) across multiple learning episodes and varying retention intervals. The "final test" phase described in the 23 model, which places a greater emphasis on unchanging context, provides a specific paradigm for exploring the transition from reliance on recent, fluctuating contextual cues to more enduring, stable contextual representations. By pursuing these empirical and modeling objectives, this dissertation seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive and mechanistically explicit understanding of the dynamic interplay between context and episodic memory.

### **1.7. Structure of the Dissertation**
