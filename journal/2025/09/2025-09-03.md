## daily note
-  add claude into proxy rule [allDay:: true]
-  bluetooth mouse [allDay:: true]

  - Your system's default Bluetooth manager couldn't properly pair the mouse
  - Installing blueman gave you a better tool that successfully connected it
  - Blueman handles authentication and pairing protocols more reliably


  Yes, you should prefer Blueman now that it's installed:
  - Launch with: blueman-manager
  - Or find "Bluetooth Manager" in your applications menu
  - It's especially good for mice, keyboards, and audio devices that the
  default manager struggles with


- installed [[solaar]] (for logic connection) 



------

● To add Anthropic/Claude domains to Clash Verge rules:

  1. Open Clash Verge
  2. Go to "Profiles" tab
  3. Click the edit button (pencil icon) next to your active profile
  4. Find the "rules:" section and add these lines at the top:

  rules:
```
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,anthropic.com,PROXY
```
```
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,claude.ai,PROXY
```
```
DOMAIN-KEYWORD,claude,PROXY
```
```
DOMAIN-KEYWORD,anthropic,PROXY
```


```
prepend: []

append:

- 'DOMAIN,DOMAIN-SUFFIX,anthropic.com,PROXY,DIRECT'

- 'DOMAIN-SUFFIX,claude.ai,PROXY'

- 'DOMAIN-KEYWORD,claude,PROXY'

- 'DOMAIN-KEYWORD,anthropic,PROXY'

delete: []
```



  5. Save and switch to "Rule" mode

  That's it! Claude Code will now work in rule mode instead of needing
  global mode.

```bash
  # Create the script
  nano ~/bluetooth-mouse-connect.sh

  Add this content:
  #!/bin/bash
  sleep 10
  bluetoothctl connect F6:AA:20:68:98:81

  # Make executable
  chmod +x ~/bluetooth-mouse-connect.sh

  Add to startup:

  # Add to your shell startup file
