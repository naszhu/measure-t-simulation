In measure terms:

- “Resource” $J_i$​ is the _local density_ of precision per item,  
    not the total measure mass.
    
- “Infinite resource” = local density diverges (Dirac-like precision),  
    but the integral over items (total resource) can still be finite or undefined only in the trivial λ = 0 limit.
    
- The model still operates in a **σ-finite measure space** — i.e., all resource distributions are integrable for any λ > 0.
