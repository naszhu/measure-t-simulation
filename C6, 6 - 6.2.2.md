# Chapter 6: Recognition memory decisions made with short- and long-term retrieval (Lai, Cao, & Shiffrin, 2024)

## 6.1 Introduction: Relevance to the Dissertation's Themes

The preceding chapters have detailed an investigation into the role of context in episodic memory through two novel recognition experiments and the development of an extended Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) framework designed to account for the observed empirical patterns. That work focused specifically on disentangling the contributions of changing and unchanging context features, context drift, and memory updating during test, providing a detailed, process-based account within a specific theoretical architecture.

This chapter presents a complementary line of research, originally published as Lai, Cao, and Shiffrin (2024), that addresses the core themes of this dissertation—namely, the interplay between short-term and long-term memory, the mechanisms of learning, and the power of computational modeling—from a different but convergent perspective. While the experiments in Chapters 3 and 4 utilized a continuous list-learning paradigm, the work detailed here employs a classic short-list probe recognition paradigm. This paradigm is used to systematically explore how recognition decisions are made across distinct trial types that manipulate the consistency of stimulus-response mappings: All-New (AN), Varied Mapping (VM), and Consistent Mapping (CM) conditions.

Furthermore, this study introduces and validates a different class of computational model, the SLR23 model, which is implemented within an Exemplar-Based Random Walk (EBRW) framework. This approach differs from the REM-based model developed in Chapter 5, yet it seeks to explain a similar fundamental trade-off: the competition between recently acquired episodic information (familiarity from short-term event traces) and well-learned associations (retrieval from long-term knowledge traces).

By including this published work, this dissertation aims to achieve several goals. First, it demonstrates that the theoretical principles concerning the interaction of memory systems are robust and not confined to a single experimental paradigm or modeling framework. Second, it offers a clear empirical demonstration of how response learning can be methodologically isolated from item familiarity, a central challenge in memory research. Finally, by presenting a cohesive and successful model that accounts for both accuracy and response time data across a vast and complex set of conditions, it reinforces the dissertation’s primary argument that a comprehensive understanding of memory requires the integration of diverse behavioral data with rigorous, process-oriented computational modeling. This chapter, therefore, serves not as a diversion, but as a parallel line of evidence that strengthens the overall conclusions about the multifaceted nature of human recognition memory.

### 6.2.1 Abstract

In the present research, we produce a coherent account of the storage and retrieval processes in short- and long-term event memory, and long-term knowledge, that produce response accuracy and response time in a wide variety of conditions in our studies of recognition memory. Two to nine pictures are studied sequentially followed by a target or foil test picture in four conditions used in Nosofsky et al. (https://www.google.com/search?q=2021) and in our new paradigm: VM: target and foil responses to a given stimulus change from trial to trial; CM: the responses do not change from trial to trial; AN: every trial uses new stimuli; MIXED: combinations of VM, CN, and AN occur on each trial. In the new paradigm a given picture is equally often tested as old or new, but only in CM is the response key the same and learnable. Our model has components that have appeared in a variety of prior accounts, including learning and familiarity, but are given support by our demonstration that accuracy and response time data from a large variety of conditions can be predicted by these processes acting together, with parameter values that largely are unchanged.

### 6.2.2 Introduction and Background

The fundamental goal of the research presented in this paper was to produce a comprehensive and cohesive account of how the varied processes of storage and retrieval in both short- and long-term memory work in concert to guide recognition decisions. The approach moves beyond testing singular hypotheses and instead aims to demonstrate that a unified set of memory processes, when integrated into a single computational theory, can explain the primary accuracy and response time results from a wide array of short-term recognition studies. The success of this endeavor is not judged by whether an individual finding supports or refutes a specific hypothesis, but rather by the model's ability to account for the entire pattern of results across numerous conditions with a consistent and conceptually plausible set of parameters.

This effort was motivated in part by challenges encountered in prior modeling work. For instance, a model developed by Nosofsky et al. [cite_start](https://www.google.com/search?q=2021), termed SLR21, struggled to account for a subset of the data discussed here without resorting to separate parameter values for different conditions and adopting parameter values that lacked clear conceptual justification. The research in this paper, therefore, sought to develop an improved model, SLR23, that could not only explain the findings from the earlier study but also new data from a novel experimental paradigm, all while maintaining a more parsimonious and theoretically sound structure.

The experimental work revolves around a probe recognition task where participants study a short, sequentially presented list of pictures (ranging from 2 to 9 items) and must then decide if a test probe was on that list (a 'target') or not (a 'foil'). This task was implemented across three primary conditions designed to manipulate the nature of the memory representations being used:

- **All-New (AN):** Every trial uses new picture stimuli that have never been seen before in the experiment. Performance in this condition relies primarily on retrieving event traces from the current study list held in short-term memory.
    
- **Varied Mapping (VM):** A fixed set of pictures is used throughout the experiment, with each picture serving as a target on some trials and a foil on others with equal frequency. Because the correct response for any given item is inconsistent, participants cannot learn a fixed stimulus-response mapping. Decisions must be based on episodic information, but retrieval is complicated by interference from long-term event traces from prior trials, which add noise and harm performance.
    
- **Consistent Mapping (CM):** A fixed set of items is used, and the correct response for each item remains consistent throughout the experiment. This consistency allows for the gradual formation of long-term knowledge traces that associate a stimulus with its correct response, a process akin to learning.
    

A critical innovation of this research was the introduction of a new CM paradigm designed to unambiguously isolate the effects of response learning from those of differential familiarity. In standard CM paradigms, targets are both studied and tested, while foils are only tested, meaning CM targets are encountered more frequently than CM foils. This frequency difference creates a confound: superior performance for CM targets could be due to either the learned response association or simply greater item familiarity from more exposures. The new paradigm resolves this by designing trials such that every CM picture is tested equally often as a target and as a foil. However, the physical response key required for a given picture remains constant (e.g., a specific picture always requires a 'left key' press, whether it's a target on a left-side trial or a foil on a right-side trial). This design equates the long-term familiarity of CM targets and foils, ensuring that any performance advantage of CM over VM must be attributed to the learning of the consistent stimulus-response mapping.

Theoretically, the SLR23 model developed to account for these phenomena posits that recognition decisions emerge from an evidence accumulation process, conceptualized as a random walk toward a 'target' or 'foil' boundary. The direction of this walk is governed by the joint influence of two distinct retrieval processes operating in parallel: familiarity and learning.

1. **Familiarity** is based on the summed activation of memory traces from both short-term memory (the current list) and long-term event memory (prior lists). This activation is driven by the similarity between the test probe and the stored traces, independent of the response associated with those traces. It is a graded, probabilistic signal that contributes to the random walk.
    
2. **Learning** is conceptualized as the retrieval of a learned response from a stable, long-term _knowledge trace_. This process is most relevant in CM conditions where consistent training allows such traces to form. Unlike the probabilistic influence of familiarity, the activation of a knowledge trace provides a direct, non-probabilistic push toward the specific response boundary encoded within it.
    

The overall step in the evidence accumulation process is thus a probabilistic outcome of the combined force of these two components. By integrating these established memory concepts into a single, cohesive model, the paper demonstrates that their joint operation can successfully predict the complex patterns of accuracy and response time across this wide variety of experimental conditions.
