it is about the possiblity of a very small range of value, almost like "a point"

[[TODO LIST - long term]]I now understand most of [[continuous]] density, but not really for [[descrete]] density


- two ways of writing density function?
p_X(x).? 

well, i know X is acutally X(omega)
, in continuous:
P(X) actually is P(X<x|{omega \in B}).? or what again ? [[TODO LIST - long term]]
and also, how to represent density as $F_M(x)$ or sth like that?... don't know
