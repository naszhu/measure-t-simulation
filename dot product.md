$$\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = |\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}| \cos(\theta)$$


$$\mathbf{A} = [a_1, a_2, a_3]$$

$$\mathbf{B} = [b_1, b_2, b_3]$$
$$\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = (a_1 \cdot b_1) + (a_2 \cdot b_2) + (a_3 \cdot b_3)$$


It's measuring the similarity between two vector basing on only one vector's dimension direction, or, only one direction. 

y: look at x through y's dimension, how x is compressed in to this dimension 

**seeing how much these two vector can 'cooperate' in one dimension (as in set theory by seeing the number of lines between two sets being dot product, and also in geometric meaning, the area)**

[[Question]]: 为什么一个空间都是一维的了， 看另外一条线的时候还需要画垂直的两条线， 我感觉是因为垂直的两条线，垂直的时候，就相当于另一个dimension可以被compress （？）

[solved Question] Why , through perspective of set theory, the two sets are 1 to 1 correspondent, now, how do you know which one correspondent to which? so there is an order now introduced for each element in the set? 
Oh, ok i think i sort of get it. Think of each element in the set to be a single dimension, and you are forming N dimension space. Now this space needs to connect with the the other space from the other set. But the connection method could be different, you are just **coincidently** having one direction of it to combine with the other on what dimension. Its just coincident, same to the set when you are combining them. Within one space itself, there is no order between elements. But if the observer is from another space (another space in another dimension or in a dimension that is lower rank than the current dimension) then the observed you has to be 'projected', thus, ordered, i.e., each dimension is not equivalent now they cant exchange freely anymore. 




**The Observer Effect (Projection):** You are right that "observed you has to be 'projected', thus, ordered." In [[Quantum]] Mechanics (which relies heavily on dot products), this is exactly what happens. A "state" (Vector A) exists in a super-position (unordered potential). But when we "Observe" it (Dot product it with a measurement vector B), we force it to collapse into a specific value relative to B.
