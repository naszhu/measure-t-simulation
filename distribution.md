distribution describes [[variability]]/[[spread]] of [[Sample space - Omega]], not [[structure]]!!

---

- An “[[event]]” = one unfolding of the process (one ball drop, one minute of arrivals).
    
- A “[[distribution]]” = the accumulated pattern across many possible unfoldings.
    
- “[[expectation]]” = the long-run balance point of that pattern.
    
- “[[variance]] ” = the long-run spread of that pattern.

- A distribution is the **shape of possibility** generated by a repeatable process.
    
- Different distributions correspond to different assumptions about how that process unfolds in time or structure.
    
- Expectation and variance are _summary handles_ on that shape, not independent things.

-- gives overall spread (vs. most informative dimension) [[TODO LIST - long term]]: relationship between these two?? gotta exist something here.

[[TODO LIST - long term]]: i still have to figure out relationships between distribution and mapping function, a little fuzzy here, of how you get a distribution, from practical flow vs. theoretical flow

[[Poisson distribution]]

Bernoulli -> Binomial -> $np\rightarrow\lambda, n\rightarrow +\infty,p\rightarrow 0$ [[Poisson process]]  -> $\lambda$ $\rightarrow \infty$: normal 

Categorical -> Multinomial -> multinomial-poisson -> multinormal distribution

P: measure
P(A): probability, $A\in \Omega$
$P_X(x)$ probability $x\in X$ ..? 
p(x): density
p: can be a parameter (like that in binomial)

[[Bernoulli Distribution]], extension is [[Categorical Distribution]], the later, sum pi=1, prior p1+p2=1, draw ONE sample

[[Binomial Distribution]], extension is [[Multinomial Distribution]]

## sampling
[[population distribution]]
[[sampling distribution]]

**Sampling context**:

- **Population distribution**: P_X (distribution on 𝒳)
    
- **Sampling distribution**: Distribution of a _statistic_ (e.g., sample mean)
    
    - Derived from multiple draws from P_X
