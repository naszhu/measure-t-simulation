集合是“无度量的存在”；  
测度是“存在被赋予偏向”；  
密度就是“对称性被破缺的集合结构”。
## From Set Theory to the Continuous Universe

### 1. Primitive Layer: Pure Set Theory

- **Start with a set** ( X ).  
    Example: ( X = \mathbb{R} ) (the set of real numbers).
    
- **Operations**: union ((\cup)), intersection ((\cap)), complement ((\complement)).  
    These define how subsets of (X) relate to each other.
    
- **Goal**: extend the idea of "counting elements" to a notion of continuous size.

### 2. Structural Layer: From Power Set to Sigma-Algebra

- The power set ( \mathcal{P}(X) ) contains _all_ subsets of (X).  
    But not all subsets behave well under infinite operations.
    
- Define a **σ-algebra** ( \Sigma \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X) ) such that:
    
    1. (X \in \Sigma);
        
    2. if (A \in \Sigma), then (A^c \in \Sigma);
        
    3. if (A_1, A_2, ... \in \Sigma), then (\bigcup_i A_i \in \Sigma).
        
- This ensures _closure under countable limits_, a necessary condition for continuity.

### 3. Quantitative Layer: Measure as Continuous Counting

- Define a **measure** as a function ( \mu: \Sigma \to [0, +\infty] ) satisfying:
    
    - (Non-negativity) ( \mu(A) \ge 0.)
        
    - (Countable additivity) If (A_i) are disjoint, then:  
        [  
        \mu\left(\bigcup_i A_i\right) = \sum_i \mu(A_i).  
        ]
        
- Intuitively, (\mu(A)) generalizes the _number of points_ in (A) to continuous settings.
    
- The triplet ((X, \Sigma, \mu)) forms a **measure space**.

### 4. Geometric Layer: From Measure to Volume (Lebesgue Measure)

- On ( \mathbb{R}^n ), define simple sets (rectangles):  
    [  
    R = [a_1,b_1] \times \dots \times [a_n,b_n], \quad \mu(R) = \prod_i (b_i - a_i).  
    ]
    
- Extend this rule to arbitrary measurable sets by **outer approximation**:  
    [  
    \mu^*(E) = \inf \left{ \sum_i \mu(R_i) : E \subseteq \bigcup_i R_i \right}.  
    ]
    
- Restrict (\mu^*) to the σ-algebra of sets that satisfy Carathéodory’s condition: these form the **Lebesgue measurable sets**.
    
- The resulting (\mu) is the **Lebesgue measure**: a translation- and rotation-invariant notion of area/volume.
    

---

### 5. Functional Layer: From Measure to Integration

- Given a measurable function ( f: X \to \mathbb{R} ), define the integral as a limit of step functions:
    
    1. Approximate (f) by simple functions (s_n = \sum_i a_i 1_{A_i}) where (A_i) are measurable.
        
    2. Define:  
        [  
        \int s_n , d\mu = \sum_i a_i \mu(A_i).  
        ]
        
    3. Take the supremum over all such approximations:  
        [  
        \int f , d\mu = \sup_n \int s_n , d\mu.  
        ]
        
- This creates the **Lebesgue integral**, the continuous version of summation.
    

---

### 6. Differential Layer: Local Ratio (Radon–Nikodym Derivative)

- If two measures (\mu) and (\lambda) satisfy absolute continuity ((\mu \ll \lambda)), define their local density:  
    [  
    f(x) = \frac{d\mu}{d\lambda}(x) = \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{\lambda(B(x,r))}.  
    ]
    
- This limit expresses how much “(\mu)-mass” there is per unit of “(\lambda)-mass” around (x).
    
- In probability, (\lambda) is Lebesgue measure and (\mu) is a probability measure; (f) is the probability density.

### 7. Calculus Layer: Integration and Differentiation as Duals

- Integration = global accumulation of measure-weighted values.
    
- Differentiation = local comparison of measures.
    
- The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** (in measure form):  
    [  
    \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t),dt = f(x), \quad \int_a^b f'(x),dx = f(b)-f(a).  
    ]
    
- So, calculus becomes the _differential geometry of measure spaces_.

### 9. Essence

> The continuous world is a _measure-enriched universe built on set theory_.  
> Counting became summing; summing became integrating; comparing became differentiating.  
> Every step is still a set-theoretic operation — just extended to infinity and continuity.
