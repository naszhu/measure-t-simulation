## Bridging Theory to Evidence

Academic arguments rest on explicit propositions that flow from theory and can be falsified by data.

Three essential components:

1. **The Gap:** What is unexplored?
2. **The Hypothesis:** What do you predict?
3. **The Operationalization:** How will you measure it?

## The Gap

A "gap" is not merely an absence of data. It is a contradiction in the literature, a boundary condition untested, or a theoretical debate unresolved.

Examples:

- "While X has been studied in adults, developmental trajectories remain unclear."
- "Existing models focus on conscious processing, yet automatic mechanisms are understudied."

**Case Study - Student Excerpt:** "...many papers exist analyzing women's visual attention to male bodies, but to my knowledge, no study has specifically compared heterosexual women's eye movements across different levels of body part exaggeration."

**Refinement:** "While prior research has documented visual preferences for secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., Smith, 2020), no study has systematically manipulated the degree of exaggeration to assess whether attention scales linearly or exhibits threshold effects."

---

## Hypothesis Structure

A hypothesis is falsifiable, specific, and derived from theory.

**Weak:** "Stress affects memory."

**Strong:** "Under high cognitive load, recognition accuracy will decrease by at least 15% compared to baseline conditions (H1)."

A hypothesis has three parts:

1. **Independent Variable (IV):** What you manipulate.
2. **Dependent Variable (DV):** What you measure.
3. **Direction:** The predicted relationship.

**Case Study - Explicit Hypothesis:** "Given that acute stress impairs working memory (Premise 1) and complex math tasks require working memory (Premise 2), stress will reduce performance on complex math tasks (H1)."

---

## Research Question Clarity

**Original:** "This study will investigate how women look at exaggerated male body parts."

**Revised:** "The present study employs eye-tracking methodology to assess whether fixation duration on digitally enhanced male physiques varies as a function of exaggeration magnitude (subtle vs. moderate vs. extreme)."

---

## Language Precision

**Formal vs. Informal**

Novice: "This paper looks at how people get stressed out." Advanced: "This study examines the physiological and cognitive responses to acute stressors."

Novice: "A lot of research shows..." Advanced: "Converging evidence suggests..." or "Meta-analytic findings indicate..."

**Redundancy vs. Economy**

Redundant: "The true, actual reality of the situation is that participants often times frequently misunderstood the basic, fundamental instructions."

Precise: "Participants frequently misunderstood the instructions."

Rule: One concept = One precise term.

**Case Study:** Original: "...as you can see in the table, the numbers clearly show a significant increase..." Revised: "Table 1 indicates a significant increase (t(98) = 3.45, p < .001)."

Rationale: Avoid "as you can see" (the reader can see). Avoid "clearly" (let the data speak).

## Transitional Architecture

Transitions are logical bridges, not decorative.

Weak: "Also, another study found..." Strong: "Extending this framework, subsequent research demonstrated..."

Weak: "Now I will talk about the method." Strong: "To address this hypothesis, a within-subjects design was employed."

**Logical Connectives:**

- **Therefore, thus, consequently:** Conclusion follows
- **However, nevertheless, conversely:** Contrast
- **Moreover, furthermore, additionally:** Addition
- **For instance, specifically, namely:** Exemplification

---

## Hedging vs. Confidence

**Over-hedging:** "It might possibly be suggested that perhaps there could be a potential relationship..." **Appropriate:** "These findings suggest a relationship between X and Y."

**Over-confidence:** "This study proves that X causes Y." **Appropriate:** "These results are consistent with a causal interpretation, though alternative explanations remain."

---

## Citation Strategies

**When to Cite:**

- Introducing a theoretical concept
- Reporting prior empirical findings
- Using a specialized method
- Making a controversial claim

**Do not cite:**

- Common knowledge ("Memory declines with age")
- Your own reasoning or argumentation

**Citation Styles:**

Parenthetical (Integration): "Working memory capacity predicts academic performance (Engle, 2002)."

Narrative (Attribution): "Engle (2002) demonstrated that working memory capacity predicts academic performance."

Use narrative citations when the author's identity matters (e.g., seminal work, methodological innovation).

**Case Study - Avoid Laundry Lists:**

Original: "Many studies (Smith, 2020; Jones, 2019; Lee, 2018; Kim, 2017; Garcia, 2016) show that social media affects body image."

Revised: "Converging evidence links social media exposure to body dissatisfaction (for reviews, see Holland & Tiggemann, 2016; Smith, 2020)."

---

## Theory Integration

**Case Study - Tinbergen:**

Student: "Furthermore, the concept of supranormal stimulus coined by Tinbergen, could explain the stronger response to more exaggerated body parts... even artificial versions..."

Refinement: "This heightened responsiveness may be phylogenetically grounded in Tinbergen's (1951) concept of supranormal stimuli, wherein artificial exaggerations of natural cues elicit responses stronger than the natural prototypes themselves."

## Operationalization

Translating abstract constructs into measurable variables.

|Construct (Abstract)|Operationalization (Concrete)|Critique Potential|
|---|---|---|
|"Academic Success"|GPA|Is GPA a valid proxy for learning?|
|"Anxiety"|Cortisol Level|Does physiological arousal equal subjective fear?|
|"Aggression"|Hot sauce allocation|Is this ecologically valid?|

## The Abstract: High-Density Writing

150-250 words. Zero fluff.

- **Context (1 sentence):** The hook
- **Objective (1 sentence):** The gap/hypothesis
- **Method (2-3 sentences):** N, Design, Measures
- **Results (2-3 sentences):** Key stats (p, effect size)
- **Conclusion (1 sentence):** The "So What?"

---

## Reporting Statistics

Statistics are rhetorical evidence embedded in the narrative.

Example: "Consistent with H1, a significant main effect of condition was observed, F(1, 100) = 5.4, p = .02, d = 0.45."

The narrative ("Consistent with H1") leads the sentence. The numbers support the narrative.

**Case Study - Statistical Description:**

Original: "The study found a 2x greater risk of body dissatisfaction... This substantial jump..."

Revised: "The high-usage group demonstrated a two-fold increase in risk (OR = 2.0)... This magnitude of effect suggests a robust association..."

Avoid "jump" (too colloquial). Use "increase," "elevation," or "effect magnitude."

---

## The Discussion Section

**The Reverse Funnel:**

1. **The Answer:** State clearly if H1 was supported (no stats)
2. **The Integration:** Link back to the Intro citations
3. **The Explanation:** Speculate on mechanism
4. **The Broadening:** Implications for the world

**Contextualization Example:** "These findings align with the Ego Depletion model (Baumeister, 1998), suggesting that self-control is indeed a finite resource. However, the lack of effect in the morning condition challenges the assumption that depletion is solely a function of task duration..."
