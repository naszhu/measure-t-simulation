#### **A. Metric Space (The concept of "Distance")**

A **Metric Space** is a set $X$ paired with a function $d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ (the metric) that satisfies four strict axioms for all $x, y, z \in X$:

1. **Non-negativity:** $d(x, y) \ge 0$.
    
2. **Identity of Indiscernibles:** $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$.
    
3. **Symmetry:** $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$.
    
4. **Triangle Inequality:** $d(x, z) \le d(x, y) + d(y, z)$.
    

- **Essence:** A space where "nearness" is rigid. It tells you how far apart things are, but **not** where the "origin" is, or how to "add" points together.
    
- _Example:_ A rock climbing wall. You know the distance between holds, but there is no "zero" hold, and adding two holds doesn't make a new hold.
