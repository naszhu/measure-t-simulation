[[Question]]: i feel like "outcome" necessarily means a kind of "sampling?"
### definition:

- A **stochastic process** is usually defined as a collection of [[random variable]]s indexed by [[TIME]] or some other dimension.

- **Unknown Outcomes**: The future states of a stochastic process are not fully determined by the past; they are probabilistic in nature.



- The key aspect of a stochastic process is that the **random variables** (RVs) are **related** in some way over time (or space). Specifically, the [[relationship] ] between the RVs** can be characterized by **correlation**, **dependence**, or **transition probabilities** (how one state leads to another).
