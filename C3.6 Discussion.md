### **3.6. Discussion of Experiment 1 Findings**

The primary goal of Experiment 1 was to generate a rich, high-resolution dataset capable of illuminating the multifaceted role of context in recognition memory and providing stringent empirical benchmarks for the development of a sophisticated computational model. By employing a multi-list design followed by a comprehensive, cumulative final test, the experiment systematically manipulated learning history, proactive interference, and retrieval dynamics. The preceding results sections have detailed a complex constellation of findings, some of which replicate classic memory phenomena in a new paradigm, and others of which are novel and theoretically challenging. This section synthesizes these key results, discusses their profound implications for our understanding of how context is encoded, represented, and utilized during memory retrieval, and explicitly outlines the critical pointers these findings provide for the computational modeling efforts detailed in Chapter 5.

#### **3.6.1. Summary of Key Results**

The empirical landscape painted by Experiment 1 is detailed and nuanced. Before delving into a theoretical interpretation, it is useful to provide a consolidated summary of the major findings from both the initial study-test phase and the final, cumulative test.

The **initial study-test phase**, consisting of ten sequential lists, revealed several key dynamics operating at both between-list and within-list timescales. First, the data showed clear and compelling evidence for the build-up of **proactive interference (PI)**. This was not a general degradation of memory but a highly selective impairment: the Hit Rate for target items showed a systematic decline across the ten lists, while the Correct Rejection rate for entirely novel foils remained remarkably high and stable. This dissociation suggests that interference arose from the increasing confusability among stored memory traces, not from attentional lapses or fatigue. Second, within each list, recognition performance was strongly modulated by an item's original **study position**. The analysis revealed a classic U-shaped serial position curve, with a robust primacy effect for early-list items and a more modest recency effect for the final items studied. This confirms that the temporal position of an item during encoding has a lasting impact on its memorability. Third, and perhaps most surprisingly, the dynamics during the test phase showed a pattern antithetical to traditional **output interference**. Instead of performance declining, the Hit Rate for target items systematically _improved_ as the test progressed, while the Correct Rejection rate for foils showed a slight decline. This suggests a process of retrieval-based facilitation or context reinstatement operating within each coherent test list, a finding that challenges models that predict only interference from retrieval.

The **final, cumulative test phase** provided a deep probe into the long-term state of the memory system, revealing how memories were retained, structured, and accessed after the entire learning history had been established. The results from this phase were equally rich. First, there was a powerful effect of an item's **initial learning history**. Items that had been both studied and tested (S&T) in the initial phase were recognized with far greater accuracy than items that had only been studied (SO). This demonstrates a potent and long-lasting testing effect. A second, striking finding was the statistical equivalence in final test performance between Studied-Only (SO) items and items that had only been seen as foils (PTF), suggesting that a single intentional study trial and a single incidental test exposure created memory traces of comparable long-term strength. Third, the final test revealed a robust **long-term serial position curve**, with both primacy and recency effects evident across the span of the original ten lists. The presence of long-term recency, in particular, points toward the use of a dynamic temporal context signal at retrieval. Fourth, the between-subjects manipulation of **retrieval order** (Forward, Backward, vs. Random) yielded minimal effects on performance, suggesting that participants were largely unable to use explicit cues about list origin to strategically guide their memory search. Finally, in stark contrast to the initial tests, the final test exhibited strong and pervasive **output interference**, with performance for all item types declining steadily over the course of the 420-trial session.

#### **3.6.2. Implications for the Role of Context in Memory**

This complex pattern of results holds significant implications for theories of episodic memory, particularly concerning the central role of context. The findings allow us to refine our understanding of context as a dynamic entity that is integral to trace formation, retrieval success, and the structure of long-term memory.

**Context as a Double-Edged Sword: Interference and Isolation** The results of Experiment 1 vividly illustrate that context plays a dual role in memory retrieval: it is both the source of interference and the basis for isolation. The proactive interference effect seen during the initial tests is a clear demonstration of context-based interference. The selective decline in Hit Rate, while CR Rate remained high, shows that the problem was not a general failure of memory but a specific failure of discrimination. As participants progressed through the lists, they accumulated memory traces associated with distinct but similar experimental contexts. When presented with a target from List N, its retrieval cue activated not only the correct trace from List N but also a growing number of "competitor" traces from prior lists (1 through N-1). This "context noise" makes it progressively more difficult to isolate the trace associated with the correct source context, thereby reducing the diagnostic evidence for a "hit" decision.

Conversely, the very act of trying to make a recognition decision implies an attempt to use context for isolation. To answer "was this picture on the list I just saw?", the cognitive system must use the current temporal context as a crucial part of the memory probe to focus the search on the most recent list. The PI effect shows that this focusing mechanism is imperfect and susceptible to interference from temporally adjacent or similar contexts. Furthermore, the minimal impact of the explicit retrieval order manipulation in the final test reinforces this point. Even when given a direct cue pointing to a specific prior list context, participants were largely unable to use it to overcome the massive interference and selectively isolate traces from that list. This suggests that the strategic, top-down control of context-based retrieval is limited, especially in high-interference environments.

**The Dynamics of Context Reinstatement** While context can be a source of between-list interference, the results also show it can be a powerful source of within-list facilitation. The finding that Hit Rates _increased_ during each initial 20-trial test block is strong evidence for a process of context reinstatement. A plausible interpretation is that the initial test trials, whether hits or correct rejections, serve to "warm up" or reactivate the specific context of the list that was just studied. Each successfully retrieved target not only brings its own item information to mind but also strengthens the representation of the shared list context. This progressively reinstated context then serves as a more effective and more diagnostic cue for subsequent items from that same list, leading to higher accuracy and faster response times.

This facilitation effect, however, was completely absent in the final test, replaced by strong output interference. This reversal is highly informative. The initial tests were short, homogenous, and temporally coherent retrieval episodes. The final test was a long, heterogeneous retrieval episode, drawing items from ten different original contexts. In this environment, any reinstatement of one specific list context triggered by a test item would be immediately disrupted by the presentation of the next item, which likely came from a different list context. Instead of a single context being progressively strengthened, the system is forced to rapidly switch between different contextual retrieval sets. This, combined with the continuous updating of memory with new foil traces and strengthened target traces, creates immense interference that overwhelms any potential for facilitation. This contrast highlights that context reinstatement is a powerful facilitator only when retrieval is focused on a single, coherent episode.

**The Structure of Contextual Representations: Evidence for a Dual-Component Model** Perhaps the most profound implication of the final test results relates to the underlying structure of contextual representations themselves. The data exhibit both long-term primacy (good memory for List 1) and strong long-term recency (good memory for List 10). The ability to access information from the very beginning of a long, interference-filled session, coupled with a temporal gradient favoring the most recent information, places strong constraints on any theory of context.

These findings strongly support a dual-component model of context, such as the one implemented in the extended REM framework for this dissertation. This model posits that the context vector associated with any memory trace is composed of two types of features:

1. **Changing Context (CC) Features:** These features drift and change slowly over time and with experience, serving as a temporal marker that differentiates one list from another. The state of this changing context vector is what underlies the recency effect; the context at the time of test is always most similar to the context of the most recent events.
    
2. **Unchanging Context (UC) Features:** These features remain stable throughout the entire experimental session and represent the general physical, emotional, and cognitive environment of the experiment (e.g., being in a memory study, using a specific computer, the overall task goals).
    

The final test results can be elegantly explained by a strategic shift in how these two contextual components are used for retrieval. To access memories from the entire session, including the earliest lists, the memory system must rely on cues that were present at both the beginning and the end of the experiment. Therefore, it is proposed that for the final test, participants shift to a retrieval strategy that heavily weights the stable UC features in the memory probe. This allows the memory search to be successfully directed to the broad set of "all items seen in this experiment." However, the strong long-term recency effect shows that the CC features are not discarded entirely but are given a smaller weight (e.g., 10%) in the retrieval cue. This blended cue allows for both broad accessibility across the entire session (via UC) and a temporal gradient favoring recent items (via CC). This proposed mechanism also explains why the list-specific retrieval order cues were ineffective: those cues pertain to the CC features, which were being largely down-weighted during final test retrieval.

#### **3.6.3. Pointers for Computational Modeling**

The rich dataset from Experiment 1 was not collected merely to document memory phenomena, but to provide a rigorous set of empirical targets to guide and constrain the development of the extended REM model presented in Chapter 5. The success of the model will be judged by its ability to simultaneously account for the entire constellation of findings using a single, coherent set of mechanisms and parameters. The key results from Experiment 1 translate directly into a series of critical benchmarks for the model.

**Benchmark 1: Capturing the Proactive Interference Dissociation.** The model must replicate the selective decline in Hit Rate across lists while maintaining a stable, high Correct Rejection rate for novel foils. This requires a mechanism whereby traces from prior lists are activated by a current target probe, thus lowering its computed odds value, without affecting the odds value of a truly novel item that matches no stored traces.

**Benchmark 2: Reconciling Opposite Test Dynamics.** This is a formidable challenge. The model must explain retrieval-based facilitation within the short, coherent initial tests, and strong output interference in the long, mixed final test. Accounting for the initial test facilitation likely requires a dynamic interaction between context reinstatement (where retrieval of an item strengthens the shared context cue for subsequent trials) and memory updating (strengthening of retrieved traces) as viewed through a context-based filter that gates trace activation. To then explain the reversal to OI in the final test, the model must show how these same mechanisms, when applied over a longer, more heterogeneous retrieval period, lead to overwhelming interference. This may also require incorporating assumptions about context drift _during_ the final test itself and a stricter decision criterion to combat the high levels of interference.

**Benchmark 3: Modeling the Full Long-Term Retention Curve.** The model must generate the U-shaped long-term serial position curve, with both primacy and recency. As discussed, this necessitates a dual-component context representation (CC and UC) and a mechanism for shifting the weighting of these components in the retrieval probe between the initial and final tests. The model’s ability to capture this pattern is a direct test of its core assumptions about the structure and use of contextual information over long periods.

**Benchmark 4: Accounting for Item History Effects.** The model’s learning and updating rules must naturally produce the observed hierarchy of memory strength: S&T > SO ≈ PTF. The mechanism for trace strengthening upon successful retrieval must be potent enough to account for the large (>20%) testing effect. Furthermore, the model's fundamental assumptions about trace formation must apply not only to intentionally studied items but also to incidentally encountered foils that are correctly rejected, thereby explaining the surprising equivalence in their long-term retention.

In conclusion, Experiment 1 was successful in generating a detailed and challenging set of empirical results. These findings have sharpened our theoretical understanding of memory context, highlighting its dual role in interference and facilitation, and pointing toward a multi-component structure that supports memory over different timescales. Most importantly, these results provide a clear and rigorous roadmap for the quantitative evaluation of the extended REM model, ensuring that its theoretical claims are firmly grounded in empirical reality.
