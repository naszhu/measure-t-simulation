# 🌟 Min — Lesson Notes (Nov 17)

These are your complete notes for today, covering:
- The parts of Lesson 1 slides we *did not* finish in class  
- Lesson 2 slides 1–3  
- Extra explanation & mini-practice for **chunking**, since you said you still don’t fully get it  
- A short, targeted homework assignment for extra practice

# 1. 🔹 Lesson 1 — Remaining Slides (Slides 20–24)

These slides continue from where Lesson 1 class notes ended. They deepen nominalization, chunking, and critical thinking.

---

## **Slide 20–21: Real-World Nominalization Practice**
These slides show how to transform everyday sentences into professional, academic versions:

### **Key Patterns**
- **Verb → Noun**
  - train → training  
  - improve → improvement  
  - decide → decision  
  - evaluate → evaluation  

### **Why this matters**
Nominalization turns:
- personal actions → *abstract processes*  
- subjective tone → *professional tone*  
- individual activity → *generalized principle*

### **Example**
Weak: *The coach trained athletes every day and saw improvement.*  
Strong: *Daily training resulted in measurable performance improvement.*

---

## **Slide 22: Balance is Everything**
Too much nominalization → heavy, unreadable  
Too little → informal, personal  

You want:
- 60% normal verbs (clarity, energy)  
- 40% nominalization (authority, abstraction)

---

## **Slide 23–24: Synthesis of Lesson 1**
These slides summarize:

### **The Framework You Now Have**
1. **Given–New** = flow of information  
2. **Stress Position** = put the main point at the end  
3. **Cognitive Load (7±2)** = limit the pieces in a sentence  
4. **Chunking** = break complexity into multiple sentences  
5. **Dialectical thinking** = thesis → antithesis → synthesis  
6. **Nominalization** = professionalize your claims  

### **Why this matters**
Going forward, ALL paragraphs and essays depend on these rules.

---

# 2. 🔹 Lesson 2 (Slides 1–3)

Today we formally entered the **paragraph level**.

---

## **Slide 1: Bridge from Lesson 1 → Lesson 2**
You learned HOW sentences work.  
Now you learn how **paragraphs work**, using the same cognitive science logic.

---

## **Slide 2: Architecture of a Paragraph**
A paragraph = **one cognitive chunk**.

It always has:

### 1. **Topic Sentence**
- Tells reader what mental “file” to open  
- Is the paragraph’s Given  

### 2. **Evidence**
- Concrete data, examples, numbers  

### 3. **Analysis**
- Explains *why* the evidence supports the topic sentence  

### 4. **Transition**
- Bridges to the next paragraph  

This is the “PEE” structure:  
**Point → Evidence → Explanation**

---

## **Slide 3: Topic Sentences**
A strong topic sentence must be:

### ✓ Specific  
### ✓ Arguable  
### ✓ A preview of the paragraph  

Weak: *There are many benefits to green buildings.*  
Strong: *Green buildings reduce employee stress by improving air quality and daylight exposure.*

Topic sentences = the **Given-New structure at the paragraph level**.

---

# 3. 🔹 Extra explanation (feedback of practice from last time): CHUNKING 

Chunking = breaking a complex idea into **multiple sentences**, each with fewer than **7 pieces**.

### How to do it:
1. **Identify all information pieces**  
2. **Group related ideas** (method / participants / findings…)  
3. **Give each group its own sentence**  
4. **Order the sentences using Given-New**

### Example (your writing earlier):  
Original:

> Many companies have adopted flexible layouts without consideration of daylight and acoustic factors. Therefore, employees may be easily distracted, and managers tend to doubt the design. Research indicates that redesigning for optimal light and acoustics can increase productivity by 20%.

This is actually good content!  
We just rewrite using **Given–New** + **Chunking**:

1. **Given (context):** Many companies use flexible layouts.  
2. **New (problem):** But these layouts ignore light/acoustics → distraction.  
3. **Given (research gap):** This distraction creates doubt.  
4. **New (evidence):** Optimizing acoustics & daylight boosts productivity by 20%.

Rewrite:

> Many companies have adopted flexible layouts, but these designs often ignore daylight and acoustic conditions. As a result, employees become more easily distracted, and managers question the effectiveness of the layout. Research indicates that redesigning for optimal light and acoustic control can increase productivity by 20%.

# 4. 🔹 Homework practice — Nov 17  
(Short, targeted, like Lesson 1)

## **Part A — Chunking Practice (2 questions)**  
Break each item into **2–3 short sentences**, grouped by meaning.  
Keep each sentence under **7 information pieces**.

### **1.**
“Environmental psychologists found that indoor plants, natural light, and improved ventilation lower stress, improve concentration, and increase satisfaction.”

### **2.**
“Studies across several companies show that redesigned workspaces with better acoustics, flexible furniture, and increased daylight exposure lead to higher productivity, fewer distractions, and stronger team collaboration.”

---

## **Part B — Topic Sentence Practice (2 questions)**  
Write **one strong, specific, arguable topic sentence** for each prompt.

### **3.**  
A paragraph about **how natural light affects employee performance**

### **4.**  
A paragraph about **why flexible office layouts influence teamwork**
