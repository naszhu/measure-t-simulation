## **Chapter 3: Experiment 1 - Picture Recognition with Novel Foils**

### **3.1. Rationale and Aims of Experiment 1**
 
 Episodic memory, our ability to recollect specific past events, is fundamentally influenced by the context in which those events occurred. While the importance of context is widely acknowledged, the precise mechanisms by which it is encoded, represented, and utilized during memory retrieval remain active areas of investigation. Computational models of memory, such as the Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) framework, have provided valuable tools for formalizing theories about these processes. However, many standard recognition memory paradigms may not fully capture the dynamic interplay between item and context information, particularly how context evolves across multiple learning episodes and how different contextual cues contribute to recognition decisions.

Experiment 1 was designed to investigate the role of context in recognition memory using a multi-list picture recognition paradigm with novel foils. The primary aim was to examine how contextual information associated with studied items influences recognition performance, both within individual study-test lists and across a sequence of lists. By employing picture stimuli, we sought to use materials rich in perceptual detail, which are often assumed to carry significant item-specific and contextual information. The use of exclusively novel foils (i.e., pictures not previously seen in any phase of the experiment) in the initial test phases was intended to provide a clear baseline for item recognition, against which the influence of contextual factors could be more distinctly observed.

Specifically, this experiment aimed to:

1. **Examine within-list contextual effects:** Investigate how factors such as the study position of an item within a list and its test position affect recognition accuracy and response times. This allows for an exploration of how local contextual information and interference from recently processed items impact memory judgments.
    
2. **Assess between-list contextual effects:** Determine how recognition performance changes across a series of study-test lists. This addresses the accumulation of contextual information and potential interference or facilitation from prior list contexts.
    
3. **Investigate the nature of memory traces following study and test:** By including an initial study-test phase followed by a comprehensive final test phase, we aimed to explore how the act of testing itself modifies memory traces and how items encountered in different capacities (studied-only, tested-only, studied-and-tested) are subsequently recognized.
    
4. **Explore the influence of retrieval context in a final, cumulative test:** The final test phase, which included all previously studied items presented in different orders (random, forward, backward relative to initial study lists), was designed to probe how the reinstatement of broader or specific prior contexts might affect long-term retention and retrieval.
    
5. **Provide empirical data for constraining and testing computational models of memory:** A core objective was to generate a rich dataset that could inform the development and validation of an extended REM-based computational model, particularly concerning its mechanisms for context representation, context drift, and context-based filtering in recognition decisions. The detailed behavioral patterns observed in this experiment are intended to serve as critical benchmarks for the model presented in Chapter 5.
    

By addressing these aims, Experiment 1 seeks to provide deeper insights into how context is dynamically encoded and utilized in episodic recognition memory, setting the stage for computational modeling that can further elucidate these complex cognitive processes.

### **3.2. Methodology**

#### **3.2.1. Participants**


(Details on the number of participants, demographics (e.g., age range, mean age, gender distribution), recruitment method (e.g., university subject pool, online platform), and any compensation provided would be included here. For example: "Fifty undergraduate students (30 female, 20 male; mean age = 20.5 years, SD = 2.1) from the University X psychology subject pool participated in exchange for course credit.") _[Placeholder based on typical experimental reports; actual details from the study are needed]._

#### **3.2.2. Materials and Stimuli**

The stimuli consisted of a large set of color pictures depicting common objects, scenes, or animals. These pictures were sourced from [Specify source, e.g., commercially available image databases, publicly available image sets like a subset of ImageNet, or self-generated stimuli. Provide details on image resolution, size, and any normalization procedures if applicable]. A sufficient number of unique pictures were selected to ensure that all items presented during the study phases and as novel foils during the test phases were unique within the experiment for each participant. For Experiment 1, all foils presented during the initial study-test lists were novel, meaning they had not been presented in any prior study list. _[Placeholder based on typical experimental reports; specific details about the picture set size and characteristics are needed. The "current model ddescription (2).docx" mentions "picture stimuli" but not the specific number or source. The "LEA- Detailed design and model.docx" mentions "3024 pictures" for Study 2, which might be different from Experiment 1, but indicates the scale of stimuli used in this line of research.]_

#### **3.2.3. Design**

The experiment employed a within-subjects design involving an initial study-test phase composed of multiple lists, followed by a between-subject design involving final comprehensive in test phase. [With a between subject-design of random, forward, backward condition??? should I mention this here?? Also, feels like there lacks a place to fine-write the 3 conditions]

##### **3.2.3.1. Initial Study-Test Phase**

This phase consisted of 10 distinct study-test lists. Each list involved:

- **Study Trials:** Participants studied a sequence of 20 unique pictures, presented one at a time.
    
- **Test Trials:** Immediately following the study trials for that list, participants were presented with a sequence of 20 recognition test trials. These test trials consisted of 10 pictures that were presented in the immediately preceding study phase for that list (targets) and 10 pictures that were entirely new to the experiment (novel foils). The order of targets and foils within the test block was randomized for each list and each participant.

##### **3.2.3.2. Final Test Phase**

All 200 pictures that had been presented during the study phases of the 10 lists were re-presented as targets. An equal number of new pictures (200), which had not appeared in any part of the experiment previously, served as novel foils.

A key between-subjects factor of this experiment was the presentation order of the 420 trials in the final recognition test. Participants were randomly and automatically assigned to one of three conditions, controlled by a script variable (`condi`) that dictated how the sequence of trials was constructed. This assignment was balanced to ensure a roughly equal number of participants in each group, allowing for valid statistical comparisons of the effects of retrieval structure on long-term memory.

The three conditions were structured as follows:

1. **Forward Order:** In this condition, the final test trials were structured to reinstate the original temporal context of the experiment. The 420 trials were organized into 10 blocks, corresponding to the ten pretest lists. The test began with the block of items related to pretest List 1, followed by the block for List 2, and so on, proceeding sequentially up to the block for List 10. Within each block, the 21 "old" items (sampled from the S&T, SO, and PTF categories of that pretest list) and 21 novel foils were presented in a random order. This condition was designed to test hypotheses related to context reinstatement, where a retrieval order that mimics the encoding order may facilitate memory access.
    
2. **Backward Order:** This condition systematically reversed the original temporal flow. The final test began with the block of items related to the most recent pretest list (List 10), followed by the block for List 9, and so on, proceeding in reverse chronological order down to the block for List 1. As in the Forward condition, the 42 trials within each block were presented in a random order. This condition was designed to probe the dynamics of memory retrieval when the overarching temporal context is traversed in reverse, potentially altering the manifestation of primacy and recency effects.
    
3. **Random Order:** This condition served as an unstructured baseline. For participants in this group, the entire set of 420 final test trials (210 "old" and 210 "new") was flattened into a single list and presented in a new, fully randomized order that was unique for each participant. This condition measures recognition performance in the absence of any systematic temporal structure in the retrieval cues, providing a crucial baseline against which the effects of the structured Forward and Backward orders can be compared.
After the completion of all 10 initial study-test lists, participants engaged in a final, surprise test phase. This phase aimed to assess memory for all items encountered during the initial study phases.


[The precise implementation of "Forward" and "Backward" conditions, especially concerning how foils are intermixed and how inter-list and intra-list orderings are combined, would need further specification based on the actual experimental protocol.]


#### **3.2.4. Procedure**

Participants were tested individually in a quiet room. Instructions were provided on a computer screen.

- **Initial Study-Test Phase:**
    
    - For each of the 10 lists, participants were first instructed that they would see a series of pictures to remember. Each picture in the study phase was presented for a fixed duration (e.g., 3 seconds) with a brief inter-stimulus interval (ISI) (e.g., 1 second).
        
    - Following the presentation of all 20 study items for a list, participants were instructed that they would see another series of pictures, some of which they had just studied and some of which would be new. For each picture in the test phase, they were required to make an "Old" or "New" recognition judgment, typically by pressing designated keys on a keyboard. Response times were also recorded. There was no feedback provided on the accuracy of their responses during these initial test phases.
        
    - A short break or a distractor task might have been included between lists to demarcate them and minimize proactive interference from immediately preceding lists, or to allow context to drift. [Details to be confirmed from actual procedure].
        
- **Final Test Phase:**
    
    - After completing all 10 initial study-test lists, participants received instructions for the final surprise test. They were informed that they would see a large number of pictures, some of which they had encountered during the entire first part of the experiment and some of which would be new.
        
    - For each picture, they were again required to make an "Old" or "New" judgment. Presentation timing, response collection, and lack of feedback were consistent with the initial test phases.
        
    - Participants were assigned to one of the three final test order conditions (Random, Forward, Backward) if it was a between-subjects manipulation, or they completed blocks corresponding to these conditions if it was within-subjects.
        

Upon completion of the final test phase, participants were debriefed. The entire experimental session lasted approximately [40 minutes].
