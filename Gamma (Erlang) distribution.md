means that if you add up k independent exponentially distributed random variables (each with rate λ), the total sum follows a **Gamma distribution** with **shape parameter** k and **rate parameter** λ.  
This is a core result connecting **[[Poisson process]]** (which have exponential waiting times) to **Gamma-distributed finishing times**.
