## Overview: Building Your Article Step by Step

Today's lesson focuses on **practical article writing** - you'll build a complete CPE article from scratch, working through each component systematically.

## The CPE Article Question

**Task:** Write an article on stress management (280-320 words) addressing:

1. A personal experience managing stress
2. Why modern life causes stress
3. Whether stress can ever be beneficial

## Breaking Down the Requirements

### Three Essential Parts (Must Address ALL):

- **Part 1:** Personal stress management experience
- **Part 2:** Modern causes of stress
- **Part 3:** Benefits of stress (balanced discussion)

### Key Format Requirements:

- **Article format** (NOT a letter - no "Dear Editor")
- **280-320 words** (strict limit)
- **Engaging throughout** (hook readers from start to finish)

## Article Structure Plan

### Four-Paragraph Framework:

1. **Opening (50-70 words)**: Hook + introduce topic
2. **Paragraph 2 (80-100 words)**: Personal experience (Part 1)
3. **Paragraph 3 (80-100 words)**: Modern stress causes (Part 2)
4. **Conclusion (70-90 words)**: Benefits discussion (Part 3) + closing thought

## The Opening Hook - Making Readers Care

### Four Effective Hook Types:

1. **Perspective of Intense Moment**
    
    - Drop readers into a vivid scene
    - Use present tense for immediacy
    - Example: "My hands shake as I stare at the blank page. Three hours until submission, and my mind feels like static..."
2. **Sensations**
    
    - Engage physical/emotional feelings
    - Make abstract concepts tangible
    - Example: "That familiar knot tightens in your chest—the one that appears when deadlines collide..."
3. **Imaginations**
    
    - Create hypothetical scenarios
    - Use "Imagine..." to draw readers in
    - Example: "Imagine waking every morning with your first thought being a to-do list that never shrinks..."
4. **Stories**
    
    - Brief anecdote or narrative
    - Personal or observational
    - Example: "Last Tuesday, I watched a colleague answer emails during her lunch, her sandwich forgotten..."

### Hook Writing Principles:

- **Avoid clichés** (no dictionary definitions!)
- **Create immediate connection** with readers
- **Keep it concise** (1-2 sentences max)
- **Link smoothly** to your thesis

### Your Hook Formula:

1. Start with vivid moment/sensation/imagination
2. Connect to universal experience
3. Transition to article focus

## Assignment: Language Upgrade Exercise

### Instructions:

Below are two paragraphs written at C1 level. Your task is to rewrite each paragraph, upgrading the language to C2 level. Focus on:

- More sophisticated vocabulary
- Complex sentence structures
- Nuanced expressions
- Academic/professional tone

### Example 1: Article Writing (C1 Level)

**Topic: The impact of social media on relationships**

Social media has changed how people communicate with each other. Many people now prefer to send messages online instead of meeting face to face. This can make relationships weaker because people don't have real conversations anymore. When friends only interact through screens, they might not understand each other's true feelings.



### Example 2: Letter Writing (C1 Level)

**Topic: Letter to a company about a delayed product delivery**

I am writing to complain about my recent order from your company. I ordered a laptop three weeks ago, but it still hasn't arrived. The website said delivery would take 5-7 days. I have tried calling customer service many times, but nobody could give me clear information about my order.

### Your Task:

1. Rewrite both paragraphs using C2-level language
2. Maintain the same basic meaning and structure
3. Demonstrate sophisticated vocabulary and complex grammatical structures
4. Show nuanced thinking and professional expression

**Submission deadline:** With your completed article assignment

### Tips for C2 Language:

- Replace simple verbs with precise alternatives (change → transform, revolutionize)
- Use complex connectors (moreover, nevertheless, notwithstanding)
- Employ nominalization (weak → weakness, understand → comprehension)
- Add qualifying phrases for nuance (to a certain extent, arguably, ostensibly)
- Use sophisticated collocations (forge connections, erode intimacy, facilitate discourse)
- Include complex structures (participle clauses, inverted conditionals, cleft sentences)

### C1 → C2 Vocabulary Upgrades:

- **Common → Sophisticated**: important → pivotal/paramount, problem → predicament/conundrum, show → demonstrate/illustrate, help → facilitate/ameliorate, bad → detrimental/deleterious, good → beneficial/advantageous, think → contemplate/deliberate, understand → comprehend/grasp, effect → ramification/repercussion, cause → precipitate/engender, decrease → diminish/dwindle, increase → escalate/proliferate, difficult → arduous/formidable

### C2 Sentence Structure Patterns:

- **Advanced structures to incorporate**: "Not only does [subject + verb], but it also..." | "Seldom have we witnessed such..." | "Were it not for [noun], [result]" | "What [subject] fails to recognize is..." | "Having [past participle], [subject + verb]" | "Despite/Notwithstanding [noun phrase], [main clause]" | "It is precisely because [clause] that [result]" | "The extent to which [subject + verb] remains debatable" | "[Subject], whilst acknowledging [noun], maintains that..."

Good luck with your language upgrade practice!
