event-based [[prospective memory Model(PM)]]

[[prospective memory]]

They dispute [[capacity sharing]] theory, endorse [[cognitive control]] 

cog control separated into [[reactive control]] and [[proactive control]]


Blocks: (my own coding for simplicity)
* block 0: control block
* block 1: focal PM block
* block 2: non-focal PM block

Theories of PM:
- endorse [cognitive control] = [threshold] adjusting
	- [reactive control]: compare between trial types (PM trial vs. non-PM trial)
		- [inhibitory] reactive control: inhibit base on [PM accumulator] for non-PM accumulators rates (tasks)  
		- [excitatory] reactive control: excite base on [PM accumulator] for PM accumulator rates 

	- [proactive control]: compare between blocks (often [PM cost] below)
		- general proactive control
		- [selective delay] or [stimulus-specific]: Cost(word on-going, Block 1) > Cost (non-word on-going, Block 0)
			- vs, [general caution] increase: no word advantage for PM cost across block 
		- facality effect (importance effect)
- dispute [capacity sharing] = [drift rate] adjusting； [sharing of on-going task] capacity
	- **non-PM trials** (on-going trials) accumulation rate, PM block < non-PM black
- multiprocess theory: [capacity sharing] + [spontaneous process]
	- spontaneous: for the focal PM part could be spontaneous (do not use capacity)
		- it's for [PM trials] for [PM retreival] 
	- capacity sharing: use PM monitoring

Theory relation:
* spontaneous process vs. inhibition reactive control (p.870: the need to inhibit ongoing task decision process)
* 

Some important concepts:
- effect [[PM cost]]: the [RT difference] of [ongoing task]
	- Note: defined as RT difference since its initially used
	- They are to explain PM cost from different kinds of theories

Modeling approch
* they are using LBA
- they said using [[feed-forward]] interactions (essentially because they are using [[Linear Ballistic Model (LBA)]] and LBA is not able to vary by time step..
