  Journal Entry Summary

  Date: 2025-10-12Issue: Bluetooth devices (Sony LE-ULT FIELD 1 speaker)
  kept disconnecting after several seconds

  Root Cause:Audio profile conflict - Linux BlueZ was attempting to activate
   multiple Bluetooth audio profiles simultaneously (A2DP for music +
  HSP/HFP for calls). The device's Bluetooth chip could only handle one
  audio stream at a time, causing "Device or resource busy" errors and
  connection timeouts (error 110).

  Diagnostic Findings:
  - Bluetooth hardware: Working correctly (Intel chip, 0 errors)
  - Service status: Running normally
  - Logs showed: a2dp-sink profile connect failed: Device or resource busy
  and SetConfiguration: Connection timed out (110)
  - Multiple audio profiles competing for the same resource

  Solution Applied:Modified /etc/bluetooth/main.conf to disable
  Headset/Handsfree profiles:
  [General]
  Disable=Headset

  Restarted Bluetooth service: sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

  Result:System now only uses A2DP profile (high-quality audio streaming),
  eliminating the profile conflict. Speaker microphone functionality
  disabled, but music/audio streaming remains fully functional.

  File Modified: /etc/bluetooth/main.conf (line 2-3)
