### 6.2.3 Method

The methodology described in this section is adapted from the two new experiments reported in Lai, Cao, and Shiffrin (2024). The following details are drawn from their published work.

#### Overview

The experiments employed a probe recognition task using picture stimuli. On each trial, participants first studied a short list of pictures presented sequentially. The study lists varied in length, containing 2, 4, or 8 pictures, with the specific length chosen randomly for each trial; participants were not informed of the list length in advance. Following the study list, a single test picture was presented. This test probe was a target (an item from the current study list, also referred to as 'OLD') with a probability of 0.5, and a foil (an item not on the current study list, or 'NEW') with a probability of 0.5. Participants were required to make a binary OLD/NEW judgment, with both response accuracy and response time being the primary dependent measures. The studies included both 'pure' conditions, where all trials within a block were of a single type (AN, VM, or CM), and 'mixed' conditions, where study lists contained a mix of items from two of these types (Lai, Cao, & Shiffrin, 2024).

#### CM Conditions Overview

A central innovation of this research was the development of a new Consistent Mapping (CM) paradigm, which contrasts with the 'standard' CM paradigm used in prior work (e.g., Nosofsky et al., 2021). In the standard design, a given item is always a target or always a foil, which confounds response learning with item familiarity because targets are seen more often than foils. The new CM paradigm was designed to eliminate this familiarity confound. In this new design, a given CM picture is tested equally often as a target and as a foil across the experiment. However, the physical response key required for that specific picture remains constant. This was achieved by linking the correct response key to the spatial location of the trial presentation (e.g., a specific picture always required a 'left key' press, regardless of whether it was a target on a left-side trial or a foil on a right-side trial). This design equates the long-term exposure frequency for all CM and VM items, meaning any performance advantage for CM over VM can be unambiguously attributed to the learning of the consistent stimulus-response mapping (Lai, Cao, & Shiffrin, 2024).

#### Method Details for the Present Studies (New Paradigm)

The most significant feature of the new paradigm was the manipulation of the spatial location of stimulus presentation. On any given trial, the entire study list and the subsequent test probe were presented either on the left side of a central fixation point or on the right side, with the side chosen randomly. The response mapping was contingent on the presentation side: for a trial presented on the left, the left key indicated 'target' and the right key indicated 'foil'; for a right-side trial, the mapping was reversed. This design was applied to the different conditions. For CM trials, separate sets of pictures were dedicated to the left and right sides, ensuring a given picture was always mapped to the same response key. For VM trials, pictures were assigned randomly to a side on each trial, making the response key inconsistent and unlearnable (Lai, Cao, & Shiffrin, 2024).

#### Stimuli and Apparatus

The stimuli were sourced from a set of 2,400 daily life pictures. Each picture subtended a visual angle of about 7 degrees. The experiments were run on PCs using MATLAB with the Psychophysics Toolbox, and all participants were tested individually in sound-attenuated booths (Lai, Cao, & Shiffrin, 2024).

#### Trial Timing

Each trial began with a central fixation point for 0.5 seconds. The pictures in the study list were then displayed sequentially on the designated side, with each picture shown for 1 second followed by a 0.1-second interstimulus interval. The test probe then appeared and remained on screen until a response was made. A key difference between the two experiments was the location of this test probe: in Experiment 1, it appeared at the screen center, while in Experiment 2, it appeared halfway between the study position and the screen center. Following the response, feedback was provided before the next trial began (Lai, Cao, & Shiffrin, 2024).

#### Groups and Conditions

Across the two experiments, several groups of participants were run in pure and mixed conditions. Pure conditions included Pure VM (Experiments 1 & 2), Pure CM (Experiments 1 & 2), and Pure AN (Experiment 2). Mixed conditions included MIX4 (VM, CM) in Experiment 1, and both MIX8 (AN, CM) and MIX4 (AN, CM) in Experiment 2. A final group, AT (Alternating Trials), was run in Experiment 2, but its data were excluded from the main analysis due to participants' use of idiosyncratic strategies (Lai, Cao, & Shiffrin, 2024).

#### Participants

Participants were undergraduate students from Indiana University who received course credit for their time. The study was approved by the Indiana University IRB. In total, 89 participants were in Experiment 1 and 204 in Experiment 2. After excluding four participants for failing to follow instructions, the analyses included data from 370 participants across the various groups. Each session lasted approximately 45 minutes (Lai, Cao, & Shiffrin, 2024).
