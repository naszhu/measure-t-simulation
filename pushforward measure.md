[[feature space - x]]

You can say, that the original [[Measure - P]] on [[Sample space - Omega]] is P, and then you say the pushforward measure after pushing P through X onto x ([[feature space - x]]), would be written as P_X; 


But, what is the way to write f_X(x)? what this f is? ([[Question]])


### a) The probability measure

- Formally you have a probability space (Ω,F,P)
    
- A random variable $X\colon\Omega\to\mathbb R$  **pushes forward** that measure to a new measure $P_X$ on the real line.
    
- $P_X$ is only defined on [[events]] ([[Borel sets]]) in $\mathbb R$, not “at a point.” [[Question]], events=borel sets? i.e., sets=> a way to make equal points into another definition of weighted (point have mass?).
