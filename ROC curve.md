An **ROC curve** plots _hit rate (H)_ vs. _false alarm rate (FA)_ across decision thresholds; a **zROC curve** plots the same data after converting both axes to _z-scores_, making it linear under the Gaussian signal-detection model.

- **ROC → empirical sensitivity curve.**
    
- **zROC → linear diagnostic of Gaussian SDT assumptions and variance equality.**
