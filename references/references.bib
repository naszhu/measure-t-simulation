  abstract = {Recognition memory accuracy is harmed by prior testing (a.k.a., output interference [OI]; Tulving \& Arbuckle, 1966). In several experiments, we interpolated various tasks between recognition test trials. The stimuli and the tasks were more similar (lexical decision [LD] of words and nonwords) or less similar (gender identification of male and female faces) to the stimuli and task used in recognition testing. Not only did the similarity between the interpolated and recognition tasks not affect recognition accuracy but performance of the interpolated task caused no interference in subsequent recognition testing. Only the addition of recognition trials caused OI. When we presented a block of LD trials or gender identification trials before the recognition test, a decrease in accuracy was observed in the subsequent recognition tests. These results suggest a distinction between temporal context and task context, such that recognition memory performance is determined by the salience of the context cues, and the use of temporal context cues is associated with OI.},

Selective retrieval of some studied information can revive the nonretrieved information and bring recall levels back to the levels shortly after study. Strikingly, we found that time-dependent forgetting after selective retrieval mimics time-dependent forgetting after study, which implies that the revival of the forgotten memories is lasting and caused by a reset of the recall process. In the real world, retrieval of encoded episodes is often selective and is often time-lagged, like in educational settings or in eyewitness testimony situations. Our findings suggest that selective retrieval can improve people's memory in such situations.           ,              Humans remember less and less of what was encoded as more and more time passes. Selective retrieval can interrupt such time-dependent forgetting, enhancing recall not only of the retrieved but also of the nonretrieved information. The recall enhancement has been attributed to context retrieval and the idea that selective retrieval reactivates the retrieved item's temporal context during study, which can facilitate recall of other items that had a similar context at study. However, it is unclear whether context retrieval induces a transient discontinuity in the stream of temporal context only, or a more permanent updating of context that would entail a lasting interruption of time-dependent forgetting. In three experiments, we analyzed time-dependent forgetting of encoded information right after study and after time-lagged selective retrieval. Selective retrieval boosted recall of the nonretrieved information up to the levels observed directly after study. Intriguingly, it also created a restart of time-dependent forgetting that made forgetting after retrieval indistinguishable from forgetting after study and thus induced a reset of the recall process. The results suggest that selective retrieval can revive forgotten memories and cause lasting recall enhancement, effects likely mediated by context retrieval and a permanent updating of temporal context.},

Recent theoretical models have converged on a particular account, based on transient associations between independent item and context representations. In the present article, the authors present an alternative model, according to which sequence information is encoded through sustained patterns of activation within a recurrent neural network architecture. As demonstrated through a series of computer simulations, the model provides a parsimonious account for numerous benchmark characteristics of immediate serial recall, including data that have been considered to preclude the application of recurrent neural networks in this domain. Unlike most competing accounts, the model deals naturally with findings concerning the role of background knowledge in serial recall and makes contact with relevant neuroscientific data. Furthermore, the model gives rise to numerous testable predictions that differentiate it from competing theories. Taken together, the results presented indicate that recurrent neural networks may offer a useful framework for understanding short-term memory for serial order.},

Here, the many similarities between serial and free recall are noted, and it is suggested that differences may result not from the use of different mechanisms but from task demands and the involvement of rehearsal processes. Rehearsal has not previously been accommodated by temporal distinctiveness models because of their simplifying assumption that items occupy point locations along a temporal dimension in memory. Here, it is suggested that use of representations that acknowledge items' temporal extension allows the scale-similar temporal distinctiveness approach to account for several additional phenomena that lie outside the scope of other models.},

Mathematically, the theory is tractable, and it specifies the computations necessary for selection. The theory is applied to extant findings from a broad range of experimental paradigms. The findings include effects of object integrality in selective report, number and spatial position of targets in divided-attention paradigms, selection criterion and number of distracters in focused-attention paradigms, delay of selection cue in partial report, and consistent practice in search. On the whole, the quantitative fits are encouraging.},

We evaluate this model using output interference, a decline in accuracy as a function of the words presented during test. Output interference is consistent with models that allow interference from words other than the test word, when each test produces a memory trace, and hence a source of interference. Models positing interference solely from prior contexts of the test word itself predict no effect of items presented during test, without added assumptions. We find robust output interference effects in recognition memory. The effect remains intact after a long delay, when study-test lag is held constant, when feedback is provided, and when the test is yes/no or forced choice. These results are consistent with, and support the view that interference in recognition memory is due in part to interference from words other than the current test word.},

However, this conclusion is at odds with other data showing that serial recall improves dramatically when study lists approximate language at the letter and word levels and also is improved when circular lists that maintain chaining information, but confound positional information are repeated. In this paper, I demonstrate that the objections to chaining models can be overcome if one assumes that associations act as constraints on a whole of list resolution process, rather than acting in a purely feedforward fashion.},

However, most theories to date have not been applied to the accompanying pattern of response latencies, thus ignoring a rich and highly diagnostic aspect of performance. This article explores and tests the error latency predictions of four alternative mechanisms for the representation of serial order. Data from three experiments show that latency is a negative function of transposition displacement, such that list items that are reported too soon (ahead of their correct serial position) are recalled more slowly than items that are reported too late. We show by simulation that these data rule out three of the four representational mechanisms. The data support the notion that serial order is represented by a primacy gradient that is accompanied by suppression of recalled items.},

Along with the additional assumption that information within a cluster is serially ordered, the model accounts for a number of phenomena from short-term memory (with a focus on serial recall) and episodic memory (with a focus on free recall). The model also accounts for the effects of aging on serial and free recall, apparent temporal isolation effects in short- and long-term memory, and the relation between individual differences in working memory and episodic memory performance.},

  abstract = {We formalize and provide tests of a set of logical-rule models for predicting perceptual classification response times (RTs) and choice probabilities. The models are developed by synthesizing mentalarchitecture, random-walk, and decision-bound approaches. According to the models, people make independent decisions about the locations of stimuli along a set of component dimensions. Those independent decisions are then combined via logical rules to determine the overall categorization response. The time course of the independent decisions is modeled via random-walk processes operating along individual dimensions. Alternative mental architectures are used as mechanisms for combining the independent decisions to implement the logical rules. We derive fundamental qualitative contrasts for distinguishing among the predictions of the rule models and major alternative models of classification RT. We also use the models to predict detailed RT distribution data associated with individual stimuli in tasks of speeded perceptual classification.},

Most comprehensive computational models of visual word recognition (e.g., the interactive activation model, J. L. McClelland \& D. E. Rumelhart, 1981, and its successors) assume that the position of each letter within a word is perfectly encoded. Thus, these models are unable to explain the presence of effects of letter transposition (trial--trail), letter migration (beard--bread), repeated letters (moose--mouse), or subset/superset effects (faulty--faculty). The authors extend R. Ratcliff's (1981) theory of order relations for encoding of letter positions and show that the model can successfully deal with these effects. The basic assumption is that letters in the visual stimulus have distributions over positions so that the representation of one letter will extend into adjacent letter positions. To test the model, the authors conducted a series of forced-choice perceptual identification experiments. The overlap model produced very good fits to the empirical data, and even a simplified 2-parameter model was capable of producing fits for 104 observed data points with a correlation coefficient of .91.},

The tendency to initiate output with the first item for short lists (a) did not change greatly when presentation rate was increased from a medium to a fast rate under normal conditions, (b) was reduced but not eliminated by AS, and (c) was maintained at slower rates when rehearsal was allowed but decreased at slower rates when rehearsal was prevented. In Experiment 2, the overt rehearsal methodology was used, and the tendency to initiate output with the first item for short lists was present even in the absence of overt rehearsal. Experiment 3 re-examined IFR under normal encoding conditions and replicated the main findings from the normal encoding conditions of Experiment 1 while using the presentation rates and list lengths of Experiment 2. We argue that rehearsal is not strictly necessary for the tendency to initiate recall with the first item under normal conditions, but rehearsal nevertheless contributes to this effect at slower rates.},

We model retrieval as a stochastic race between a plurality of potentially relevant intentions stored in long-term memory. Psychological theories are dominated by two opposing conceptions of the role of memory in temporally extended agency -- as when a person has to remember to make a phone call in the afternoon because, in the morning, she promised she would do so. According to the Working Memory conception, remembering to make the phone call is explained in terms of the construction and maintenance of intentions in working-memory. According to the Long-Term Memory conception, we should explain the episode in terms of an ability to store intentions in long-term memory. The two conceptions predict different processing profiles. The aim of this paper is to present a new mathematical model of the type of memory mechanism that could realise the long-term memory representations of intentions necessary for the Long-Term Memory conception. We present and illustrate the formal model and propose a new type of experimental paradigm that could allow us to test which of the two conceptions provides the best explanation of the role of memory in temporally extended agency.},

  abstract = {Differentiation is a theory that originally emerged from the perception literature and proposes that with experience, the representation of stimuli becomes more distinct from or less similar to the representation of other stimuli. In recent years, the role of differentiation has played a critical role in models of memory. Differentiation mechanisms have been implemented in episodic memory models by assuming that information about new experiences with a stimulus in a particular context accumulates in a single memory trace and these updated memory traces become more distinct from the representations of other stimuli. A key implication of such models is that well encoded events are less confusable with other events. This prediction is particularly relevant for two important phenomena. One is the role of encoding strength on memory. The strength based mirror effect is the finding of higher hit rates and lower false alarm rates for a list composed of all strongly encoded items compared to a list composed of all weakly encoded items. The other is output interference, the finding that accuracy decreases across a series of test trials. Results from four experiments show a tight coupling between these two empirical phenomena such that strongly encoded target items are less prone to interference. By proposing a process model and evaluating the predictions of the model, we show how a single theoretical principle, differentiation, provides a unified explanation for these effects.},

Based on our Generalized Biased Competition account, we propose a formal race model of selection of action representations. The model explains how action representations stored in long-term memory are competing for selection based on their match to the current environmental context and their importance weight. We then present results and model fits from three experiments using a recently developed multiple cue paradigm where several attention shifts with different associated reward values are competing. We show that participants were surprisingly efficient at selecting both when the number of cues and the number of possible reward values were increased. Only when we manipulated reward contingencies and knowledge of these, did the participants show suboptimal performance. The new Generalized Biased Competition account can also explain failures of executive control exemplified by goal neglect where instructions fail to influence behavior despite being retrievable. Finally, we argue that our model may provide a unified understanding of intentions, routines, and habits. Specifically, intentions, routines, and habits may be understood as a continuous range of the same fundamental form of action representation but with variation in their strength of long-term memory traces and importance weights.},

We examined whether the failure of individuals to allocate sufficient attentional resources to nonfocal PM tasks can be linked to the response demands inherent in PM paradigms that require the PM task to race for response selection with the speeded ongoing task. In three experiments, participants performed a lexical decision task while being required to make a separate PM response to a specific word (focal), an exemplar of a category (nonfocal), or a syllable (nonfocal). We manipulated the earliest time participants could make task responses by presenting a tone at varying onsets (0--1,600 ms) following stimulus presentation. Improvements in focal PM and nonfocal PM were observed at response delays as brief as 200 ms and 400 ms, respectively. Nonfocal PM accuracy was comparable to focal PM accuracy at delays of 600 ms and 1,600 ms for categorical targets and syllable targets, respectively. Delaying task responses freed the resource-demanding processing operations used on the ongoing task for use on the nonfocal PM task, increasing the probability that the nonfocal PM features of ongoing task stimuli were adequately assessed prior to the ongoing task response.},

  abstract = {Experts act without thinking because their skill is hierarchical. A single conscious thought automatically produces a series of lower-level actions without top-down monitoring. This article presents a theory that explains how automatic control is possible in skilled typing, where thinking of a word automatically produces a rapid series of keystrokes. The theory assumes that keystrokes are selected by a context retrieval process that matches the current context to stored contexts and retrieves the key associated with the best match. The current context is generated by the typist's own actions. It represents the goal (``type DOG'') and the motor commands for the keys struck so far. Top-down control is necessary to start typing. It sets the goal in the current context, which initiates the retrieval and updating processes, which continue without top-down control until the word is finished. The theory explains phenomena of hierarchical control in skilled typing, including differential loads on higher and lower levels of processing, the importance of words, and poor explicit knowledge of key locations and finger-to-key mappings. The theory is evaluated by fitting it to error corpora from 24 skilled typists and predicting error probabilities, magnitudes, and patterns. Some of the fits are quite good. The theory has implications beyond typing. It argues that control can be automatic and shows how it is possible. The theory extends to other sequential skills, like texting or playing music. It provides new insights into mechanisms of serial order in typing, speaking, and serial recall.},

  abstract = {From the beginning of research on serial memory, chaining theories and position coding theories have been pitted against each other. The central question is whether items are associated with each other or with a set of position codes that are independent of the items. Around the turn of this century, the debate focused on serial recall tasks and patterns of error data that chaining models could not accommodate. Consequently, theories based on other ideas flourished and position coding models became prominent. We present an analysis of a retrieved context model that integrates chains and position codes. Under some parameter values, it produces classic chains. Under most parameter values, it produces context representations that contain information sufficient to specify the position codes in position coding theories. We suggest three ways to extract position codes from context representations and show the codes they produce are mathematically equivalent to the codes in position coding models. The extracted position codes can be substituted for the position codes in position coding models and run through their machinery to mimic their predictions exactly. We suggest that chains, position codes, and retrieved contexts may reflect different strategies for extracting desired information from a common set of memory representations, and we emphasize the value of considering item-dependent context representations that are made from fading traces of past items encoded or retrieved.},

The question is addressed empirically in two experiments that compare performance in whole report tasks that tap perception, serial recall tasks that tap memory, and copy typing tasks that tap action, using the same materials and participants. The data show similar effects across tasks that differ in magnitude, which is consistent with a single process operating under different constraints. The question is addressed theoretically by developing a Context Retrieval and Updating (CRU) theory of serial order, fitting it to the data from the two experiments, and generating predictions for 7 different summary measures of performance: list accuracy, serial position effects, transposition gradients, contiguity effects, error magnitudes, error types, and error ratios. Versions of the model that allowed sensitivity in perception and memory to decrease with serial position fit the data best and produced reasonably accurate predictions for everything but error ratios. Together, the theoretical and empirical results suggest a positive answer to the question: Serial order in perception, memory, and action may be governed by the same underlying mechanism.},

  abstract = {Exemplar-retrieval models such as the exemplar-based random-walk (EBRW) model (Nosofsky \& Palmeri, 1997) have provided good accounts of response-time (RT) and choice-probability data in a wide variety of categorization paradigms. In this chapter I review recent work showing that the model also accounts accurately for RT and choiceprobability data in a wide variety of probe-recognition short-term memory-search paradigms. According to the model, observers store items from study lists as individual exemplars in memory. When a test probe is presented, it causes the exemplars to be retrieved. The exemplars that are most readily retrieved are those that are highly similar to the test probe and that have the greatest memory strengths. The retrieved exemplars drive a familiarity-based evidence-accumulation process that determines the speed and accuracy of old-new recognition decisions. The model accounts for effects of memoryset size, old-new status of test probe, and study-test lag; effects of the detailed similarity structure of the memory set; and the role of the history of previously experienced memory sets on performance. Applications of the model reveal a quantitative law of how memory strength varies with the retention interval. In addition, the model provides a unified account of how probe recognition operates in cases involving short and long study lists. Furthermore, it provides an account of the classic distinction between controlled versus automatic processing depending on the types of memory-search practice in which observers engage. In short, the model brings together and extends prior research and theory on categorization, attention and automaticity, short- and long-term memory, and evidence-accumulation models of choice RT to move the field closer to a unified account of diverse forms of memory search.},

Pictures in a given list were an equal mixture of three types that varied according to the way they were used as targets and foils earlier in the same session. Under consistent-mapping (CM), targets and foils never switch roles; under varied-mapping (VM), targets and foils switch roles randomly across trials; whereas all-new (AN) items are novel on each trial of the experiment. Past research has shown that markedly enhanced performance occurs in CM conditions, leading to conclusions that item-response learning takes place in CM, perhaps automatically. However, almost all past research has compared CM, VM, and AN performance in between-blocks designs in which participants may adopt different cognitive strategies and criterion settings across the conditions. The present mixed-list design holds constant the strategy and criterion settings that are used for CM, VM, and AN items, and produced patterns of performance dramatically different than those observed in pure-list control conditions. We develop an extended version of an exemplar-based random-walk model of probe recognition to account for the major qualitative effects in the data. The data and the modeling provide evidence for strong item-response learning for CM foils but weak item-response learning for CM targets. We consider possible explanations for these effects in our General Discussion.},

This article describes a space of possible measurement models in which all existing models can be placed. The space is defined by three dimensions: (1) The choice of a activation function (von-Mises or Laplace), the choice of a response-selection function (variants of Luce's choice rule or of signal detection theory), and whether or not memory precision is assumed to be a constant over manipulations affecting memory. A factorial combination of these three variables generates all possible models in the model space. Fitting all models to eight data sets revealed a new model as empirically most adequate, which combines a von-Mises activation function with a signal-detection response-selection rule. The precision parameter can be treated as a constant across many experimental manipulations, though it might vary with manipulations not yet explored.

  abstract = {Logan (2021) presented an impressive unification of serial order tasks including whole report, typing, and serial recall in the form of the context retrieval and updating (CRU) model. Despite the wide breadth of the model's coverage, its reliance on encoding and retrieving context representations that consist of the previous items may prevent it from being able to address a number of critical benchmark findings in the serial order literature that have shaped and constrained existing theories. In this commentary, we highlight three major challenges that motivated the development of a rival class of models of serial order, namely positional models. These challenges include the mixed-list phonological similarity effect, the protrusion effect, and interposition errors in temporal grouping. Simulations indicated that CRU can address the mixed-list phonological similarity effect if phonological confusions can occur during its output stage, suggesting that the serial position curves from this paradigm do not rule out models that rely on interitem associations, as has been previously been suggested. The other two challenges are more consequential for the model's representations, and simulations indicated the model was not able to provide a complete account of them. We highlight and discuss how revisions to CRU's representations or retrieval mechanisms can address these phenomena and emphasize that a fruitful direction forward would be to either incorporate positional representations or approximate them with its existing representations.},

Despite the prevalence of this decline, there is a lack of consensus on the mechanism responsible. Three hypotheses have been put forward: (1) interference is caused by learning of test items (2) the test items cause a shift in the context representation used to cue memory and (3) participants change their speed-accuracy thresholds through the course of testing. We implemented all three possibilities in a combined model of recognition memory and decision making, which inherits the memory retrieval elements of the Osth and Dennis (2015) model and uses the diffusion decision model (DDM: Ratcliff, 1978) to generate choice and response times. We applied the model to four datasets that represent three challenges, the findings that: (1) the number of test items plays a larger role in determining performance than the number of studied items, (2) performance decreases less for strong items than weak items in pure lists but not in mixed lists, and (3) lexical decision trials interspersed between recognition test trials do not increase the rate at which performance declines. Analysis of the model's parameter estimates suggests that item interference plays a weak role in explaining the effects of recognition testing, while context drift plays a very large role. These results are consistent with prior work showing a weak role for item noise in recognition memory and that retrieval is a strong cause of context change in episodic memory.},

For example, if a set of objects of various sizes and colors can be accurately categorized using a single separable dimension (e.g., size), then category learning will be fast, while if the category is determined by both dimensions, learning will be slow. To capture these dimensional biases, almost all models of categorization supplement family resemblance with either rule-based systems or selective attention to separable dimensions.

We develop, instead, a pure family resemblance version of the Rational Model of Categorization (RMC), which we term the Rational Exclusively Family RESemblance Hierarchy (REFRESH), which does not presuppose any separable dimensions in the space of stimuli. REFRESH infers how the stimuli are clustered and uses a hierarchical prior to learn expectations about the variability of clusters across categories. We first demonstrate the dimensional alignment of natural-category features and then show how through a lifetime of categorization experience REFRESH will learn prior expectations that clusters of stimuli will align with separable dimensions. REFRESH captures the key dimensional biases and also explains their stimulus-dependence and how they are learned and develop.},

  abstract = {Event-based prospective memory (PM) requires remembering to perform intended deferred actions when particular stimuli or events are encountered in the future. We propose a detailed process theory within Braver's (2012) proactive and reactive framework of the way control is maintained over the competing demands of prospective memory decisions and decisions associated with ongoing task activities. The theory is instantiated in a quantitative ``Prospective Memory Decision Control'' (PMDC) architecture, which uses linear ballistic evidence accumulation (Brown \& Heathcote, 2008) to model both PM and ongoing decision processes. Prospective control is exerted via decision thresholds, as in Heathcote, Loft, and Remington's (2015) ``Delay Theory'' of the impact of PM demands on ongoing-task decisions. However, PMDC goes beyond Delay Theory by simultaneously accounting for both PM task decisions and ongoing task decisions. We use Bayesian estimation to apply PMDC to experiments manipulating PM target focality (i.e., the extent to which the ongoing task directs attention to the features of PM targets processed at encoding) and the relative importance of the PM task. As well as confirming Delay Theory's proactive control of ongoing task thresholds, the comprehensive account provided by PMDC allowed us to detect both proactive control of the PM accumulator threshold and reactive control of the relative rates of the PM and ongoing-task evidence accumulation processes. We discuss potential extensions of PMDC to account for other factors that may be prevalent in real-world PM, such as failures of memory retrieval.},

  abstract = {Normative models of decision-making that optimally transform noisy (sensory) information into categorical decisions qualitatively mismatch human behavior. Indeed, leading computational models have only achieved high empirical corroboration by adding task-specific assumptions that deviate from normative principles. In response, we offer a Bayesian approach that implicitly produces a posterior distribution of possible answers (hypotheses) in response to sensory information. But we assume that the brain has no direct access to this posterior, but can only sample hypotheses according to their posterior probabilities. Accordingly, we argue that the primary problem of normative concern in decision-making is integrating stochastic hypotheses, rather than stochastic sensory information, to make categorical decisions. This implies that human response variability arises mainly from posterior sampling rather than sensory noise. Because human hypothesis generation is serially correlated, hypothesis samples will be autocorrelated. Guided by this new problem formulation, we develop a new process, the Autocorrelated Bayesian Sampler (ABS), which grounds autocorrelated hypothesis generation in a sophisticated sampling algorithm. The ABS provides a single mechanism that qualitatively explains many empirical effects of probability judgments, estimates, confidence intervals, choice, confidence judgments, response times, and their relationships. Our analysis demonstrates the unifying power of a perspective shift in the exploration of normative models. It also exemplifies the proposal that the ``Bayesian brain'' operates using samples not probabilities, and that variability in human behavior may primarily reflect computational rather than sensory noise.
