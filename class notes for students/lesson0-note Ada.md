# Lesson 0: Academic Writing Foundations - Class Notes

**Date:** Nov 1, 2025
**Focus:** Sentence variety, advanced grammar, and writing rhythm

---

## Main Concepts Covered

### 1. Sentence Variety
- **Why it matters:** Repetitive patterns make readers tune out. Variety keeps them engaged.
- **Pattern-breaking principle:** Repetition = boring, variety = interesting
- **Key takeaway:** Good writing requires deliberate effort to override default patterns

### 2. Sentence Length Strategy
- **Short (5-10 words):** Good for emphasis
- **Medium (15-20 words):** Optimal for complex ideas
- **Long (25+ words):** Risk cognitive overload
- **Strategy:** Mix short and long. Short → pause → attention → long

**Practical tip:** When editing, mark where you pause naturally. Those pauses should match where your short sentences are.

## Grammar Rules

### Misplaced Modifiers
- **Rule:** Modifiers must be next to what they modify
- **Logic:** Close = clear. Your brain connects things that are close together.
- **Test:** If moving the modifier changes meaning, it's probably in the wrong place.

### Dangling Participles
- **Rule:** Participial phrases must describe the subject. The subject must be able to perform the action.
- **Memory trick:** "After doing X, Y happened" — ask "Can Y do X?" If no, it's dangling.
- **Fix:** Place the subject right after the comma

### Parallel Structure
- **Rule:** Items in a series need the same grammatical structure
- **Logic:** When you start a pattern, your brain expects it to continue
- **Check:** Isolate list items. Take them out of the sentence and look at just those items.

### Pronoun Reference
- **Rule:** Pronouns must clearly refer to a noun. If unclear, restate the noun.
- **Test:** If you have to pause and think "what does this refer to?" then it's not clear.
- **Solution:** When multiple nouns could refer, just repeat the noun. Repetition beats confusion.

### Active vs. Passive Voice
- **Active:** Focuses on who did it
- **Passive:** Focuses on what happened
- **Strategy:** Choose based on what you want readers to focus on
- **Tip:** If your sentence has "by someone" at the end, you probably could make it active.

## Writing Rhythm

### Transitions
- **Use when:** Connection isn't obvious
- **Don't overuse:** If connection is already clear, you don't need one
- **Variety matters:** Don't use the same transition repeatedly

**Common types:**
- Addition: furthermore, moreover, additionally
- Contrast: however, nevertheless, on the other hand
- Cause/Effect: therefore, consequently, as a result
- Time: meanwhile, subsequently, previously

### Sentence Beginnings
- **Variety is key:** Don't always start with "The..."
- **Options:**
  - Subject: "The study showed..."
  - Prepositional phrase: "In the study, participants..."
  - Adverb: "Significantly, the results..."
  - Participial phrase: "Having completed the study, researchers..."

**Quick trick:** Take your second or third sentence and flip it. Start with a phrase instead of the subject.

### Combining Sentences
- **When to combine:** Ideas that belong together
- **Strategy:** Main idea goes in main clause, details in subordinate clauses
- **Warning:** Don't combine too much. Better to have two clear sentences than one confusing one.

**Techniques:**
- Commas: Combine related ideas
- Semicolons: Connect independent clauses (equal importance)
- Conjunctions: Show relationships (and, but, so)
- Relative clauses: Add details (who, which, that)

## Punctuation for Clarity

### Key Principles
- Punctuation isn't decoration — it's meaning
- Wrong punctuation creates confusion
- Right punctuation creates clarity

### Common Errors
- **Comma splices:** Need semicolon or period, or add conjunction
- **Run-on sentences:** No punctuation at all — can't do that
- **Missing commas:** Necessary for clarity

**Test:** If you take out the punctuation, does the sentence still make sense? If yes, the punctuation is probably wrong or unnecessary.

## Revision Checklist

Use this systematic approach:

1. **✓ Vary sentence lengths** — Mix short and long
2. **✓ Fix grammar errors** — Check modifiers, participles, parallel structure
3. **✓ Add smooth transitions** — Connect ideas when needed
4. **✓ Vary sentence beginnings** — Don't always start the same way
5. **✓ Use proper punctuation** — Semicolons, colons, dashes correctly

**Revision process:** Do it in passes
- First pass: Variety (length, beginnings)
- Second pass: Grammar
- Third pass: Flow (transitions, combining)
- Fourth pass: Clarity (can you read without re-reading?)

## Self-Editing Techniques

### Self-Editing Questions
- Do my sentences vary in length and beginning?
- Are all modifiers clearly placed?
- Do transitions show logical relationships?
- Is my active/passive choice strategic?
- Would a reader understand without re-reading?

### Self-Assessment Methods
- **Read aloud:** Your ear catches things your eye misses. If it sounds awkward to say, it sounds awkward to read.
- **Count sentence lengths:** Look for variety
- **Circle sentence beginnings:** Check for repetition

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Clarity over elegance** — When in doubt, choose clarity
2. **Variety beats repetition** — Deliberate variety beats automatic repetition
3. **Proximity = clarity** — Related ideas should be close together
4. **One thing at a time** — Systematic checking works better than trying to fix everything at once

## Next Steps

**Optional Homework:** Bring a paragraph you wrote recently. We'll apply today's revision techniques to your actual writing.

**Next Class:** Paragraph Architecture
- Topic sentences
- Supporting evidence
- Logical structure
- How to build paragraphs that advance arguments

**Connection:** Strong sentences are building blocks. Next class we'll see how blocks become walls (paragraphs). Everything today — variety, grammar, rhythm — becomes your building materials.

## Memory Aids

- **Pattern-breaking:** Repetition = disengagement, variety = engagement
- **Modifiers:** Close = clear
- **Dangling participles:** "After doing X, Y happened" — Can Y do X?
- **Sentence length:** Short → pause → attention → long
- **Revision sequence:** Variety → Grammar → Flow → Clarity

*Remember: The writing that sounds effortless to read took effort to write. Good writing requires deliberate effort to override your brain's default patterns.*
