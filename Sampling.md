[[MCMC]]
[[MC sampling]]
[[sample]]

## definition
- - A _procedure_ (experimental or computational) that produces independent copies of ω.
- Formally modelled by the **product space** (Ωn,F⊗n,P⊗n). The σ‑algebra there is still only a bookkeeping device; the “100 flips” is encoded by taking the 100‑fold product.

### **10. Is Every Draw from a Distribution a Sampling Process?**

Yes. **Sampling** = drawing a value from a distribution, regardless of:

- Whether it's done by nature (e.g., observing ω)
    
- Or by us (e.g., Monte Carlo, posterior draws)
    
- Or mentally (as in [[auto-correlated Bayesian sampler (ABS)]])
