# Jose's Academic English Class Notes

## Academic vs Conversational English
**Key Differences:**
- Evidence-based (not opinion-based)
- Objective tone
- Precise vocabulary
- Structured thinking

**Examples:**
- "I think..." → "Research suggests..."
- "This is good/bad" → "This demonstrates effectiveness/limitations"

## Hedging Language
**Essential hedging words:**
- **Possibility**: may, might, could, possibly, perhaps
- **Probability**: likely, probably, tends to, appears to
- **Limitation**: suggests, indicates, implies, seems to
- **Caution**: however, nevertheless, although, despite

**Example**: "This suggests that sustainable architecture may contribute to stress reduction" (not "This proves...")

## Academic Vocabulary
**Upgrade your vocabulary:**
- **Size**: big → substantial, significant, considerable
- **Positive**: good → beneficial, advantageous, efficacious
- **Negative**: bad → detrimental, adverse, problematic
- **Action**: show → substantiate, corroborate, validate
- **Thinking**: think → contend, argue, postulate

## Academic Verb Patterns
**Precise academic verbs:**
- **Analysis**: analyze, examine, investigate, explore
- **Comparison**: compare, contrast, juxtapose, parallel
- **Evaluation**: assess, evaluate, critique, appraise
- **Synthesis**: synthesize, integrate, consolidate, amalgamate

**Practice**: Choose specific verbs instead of general ones ("analyze" not "look at")

## Academic Sentence Structures
**Three main structures:**

1. **Subordination** (main + dependent clause)
   - Connectors: whereas, whilst, provided that, notwithstanding that
   - Example: "Whereas traditional architecture focuses on aesthetics, sustainable design prioritizes environmental impact"

2. **Coordination** (independent + connector + independent)
   - Connectors: furthermore, nevertheless, moreover, consequently, nonetheless
   - Example: "Sustainable architecture reduces energy consumption; furthermore, it improves indoor air quality"

3. **Apposition** (main idea + explanatory phrase)
   - Example: "Biophilic design, a concept that integrates natural elements into built environments, has gained significant attention"

## Academic Tone and Voice
**Characteristics:**
- **Impersonal voice**: "Research indicates..." (not "I believe...")
- **Passive voice when appropriate**: "Buildings are designed..." (not "Architects design...")
- **Nominalization**: "spatial response patterns" (not "how people respond to space")
- **Abstract concepts**: "occupant satisfaction levels" (not "people feel happy")

## Writing Assignment

**Task**: Write a 200-250 word academic paragraph responding to this prompt:

*"To what extent should universities prioritize interdisciplinary research over traditional disciplinary approaches?"*

**Requirements**:
- Use **at least 5 advanced academic vocabulary words** from today's lesson (substantial, significant, beneficial, detrimental, analyze, evaluate, etc.)
- Include **at least 3 hedging phrases** (may suggest, appears to indicate, tends to show, etc.)
