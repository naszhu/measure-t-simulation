# Class 2 Notes - Paragraph Architecture
**Student:** John  
**Date:** 11/5/2025  
**Focus:** Module II - Paragraph Structure (Topic Sentences, Evidence, Analysis, Coherence)
**Note:** This class covered Slides 1-17 from Lesson 2: Paragraph Architecture

---

## Learning Objectives
Before next class, you will be able to:
- Identify and write clear, specific topic sentences
- Integrate evidence smoothly with proper citations
- Write analysis that explains how evidence supports your claims
- Create coherent paragraphs with smooth transitions
- Apply paragraph structure principles to psychology writing

---

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Lesson Context and Progression

We're moving from **Module I (Foundations)** - sentence-level mastery - to **Module II (Structure)** - paragraph-level organization. Last class we covered sentence variety, grammar, voice selection, and writing rhythm. Today we're building on that foundation to learn how to structure paragraphs that advance arguments systematically.

**The Logic:** Strong sentences are building blocks, but paragraphs are the architecture that makes arguments work. We need sentence-level mastery before we can organize paragraphs effectively.

### 2. Assignment Evaluation: Your Social Media Paragraph

**What You Did Well:**
- **Varied sentence beginnings** - You used different openings (Social, Through, Although, Negative, Moreover, Additionally, Messages, Consequently)
- **Transitions** - You identified and used transitions effectively
- **Citations** - You integrated citations naturally (Kaplan & Hoenlein, 2010; Turkle, 2017; Boyd, 2014; Marwick, 2011; Crystal, 2011)
- **Self-analysis** - Your markings showed you're thinking about sentence structure and flow
- **Content organization** - You covered both positive and negative aspects

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Sentence structure** - Several grammar errors need fixing (see grammar corrections slide)
- **Paragraph unity** - The paragraph covers multiple ideas - consider breaking into focused paragraphs
- **Topic sentence** - Missing a clear, single topic sentence that states the main argument
- **Evidence-analysis connection** - Some citations need more analysis explaining how they support your points
- **Sentence flow** - Some sentences could be combined or restructured for smoother flow

**Grammar Corrections Identified:**
1. Dangling/misplaced modifier: "leaping through the bounds"
2. Sentence fragment: "Negative effects such as..."
3. Missing comma after transition: "Moreover access..."
4. Incorrect comma placement: "(Boyd, 2014), can influence..."
5. Missing hyphen: "face to face" → "face-to-face"
6. Sentence fragment: "Consequently, reinforcing..."

### 3. What Makes a Strong Paragraph?

**Paragraph Unity Principle:**
- A paragraph is **one complete thought**, fully developed with supporting evidence and analysis
- It's not just a bunch of sentences about the same topic - it's a **structured argument**

**Structural Requirements:**
1. **Topic Sentence** - States the main idea clearly
2. **Supporting Evidence** - Provides specific examples, data, or citations
3. **Analysis** - Explains how evidence supports the topic sentence
4. **Transition** - Connects to next paragraph or main argument

**Psychology Connection:** In psychology research writing, paragraphs must advance arguments systematically. Each paragraph should contribute one clear point to your overall thesis, supported by evidence from research.

---

### 4. The Anatomy of a Strong Paragraph

**Strong Paragraph Components:**
- **Clear topic sentence** - Reader immediately knows your argument
- **Specific evidence with citation** - Concrete proof, not vague claims
- **Analysis explains the evidence** - You show why the evidence matters
- **All sentences support one main idea** - Everything connects back to the topic sentence

**Weak Paragraph Problems:**
- No clear topic sentence
- Evidence without analysis
- No connection between ideas
- Multiple unrelated points

---

### 5. Topic Sentences: The Foundation

**Topic Sentence Function:**
- **Purpose:** States the main point of the paragraph clearly and specifically
- **Location:** Usually the first sentence (sometimes second, for emphasis)
- **Characteristics:** Specific, arguable, and directly related to your thesis

**Weak Topic Sentences:**
- "This is about psychology." (Too vague)
- "There are many studies." (Too general)
- "CBT is good." (Too simple, no argument)
- "Some people think therapy works." (Too weak, no position)

**Strong Topic Sentences:**
- "CBT effectively treats anxiety by restructuring maladaptive cognitions."
- "Research demonstrates that mindfulness interventions reduce stress more effectively than relaxation alone."
- "Social media use correlates with increased depression symptoms in adolescents."
- "Sleep quality significantly predicts academic performance in college students."

**Topic Sentence Checklist:**
- ✓ Makes a specific, arguable claim
- ✓ Relates directly to your thesis
- ✓ Can be supported with evidence
- ✓ Clear enough for reader to predict paragraph content

---

### 6. Supporting Evidence: The Structure

**Evidence Integration Principle:**
- **Function:** Evidence proves your topic sentence is true
- **Types:** Research findings, statistical data, expert opinions, case studies
- **Integration:** Evidence must be smoothly woven into your sentences

**Poor Evidence Integration:**
- "CBT works. A study was done. Smith et al. (2023) found something. The results were good."
- Problems: Evidence feels disconnected, no context, no analysis

**Strong Evidence Integration:**
- "CBT effectively treats anxiety disorders. Smith et al. (2023) conducted a randomized controlled trial with 150 participants and found that 78% of the CBT group showed significant symptom reduction, compared to 35% in the control group. This substantial difference demonstrates CBT's effectiveness."
- Strengths: Context provided, specific numbers, analysis connects to claim

**Citation Integration Patterns:**
- **Author-focused:** "Smith et al. (2023) found that..."
- **Evidence-focused:** "Research demonstrates that... (Smith et al., 2023)"
- **Narrative:** "A 2023 study by Smith and colleagues showed..."

---

### 7. Analysis: The Connection

**Analysis Function:**
- **Purpose:** Explains HOW your evidence supports your topic sentence
- **Critical Component:** Evidence alone doesn't prove anything - analysis makes the connection explicit
- **Common Mistake:** Students provide evidence but forget to analyze it

**Example:**
- **Topic Sentence:** "CBT effectively treats anxiety disorders."
- **Evidence:** "Smith et al. (2023) found 78% improvement in CBT group vs. 35% in control group."
- **Analysis:** "This substantial difference suggests that CBT's structured approach to identifying and challenging cognitive distortions directly addresses the underlying mechanisms of anxiety, rather than merely treating symptoms."

**Analysis Questions to Ask:**
- What does this evidence mean?
- How does it support my topic sentence?
- Why is this finding significant?
- What are the implications?

---

### 8. Paragraph Coherence: The Flow

**Coherence Principle:**
- **Definition:** Logical flow between sentences within a paragraph
- **Requirement:** Each sentence should connect clearly to the previous one
- **Mechanism:** Transitions, pronouns, repetition of key terms, logical sequence

**Coherence Techniques:**
- **Transitions:** "Specifically," "Furthermore," "However"
- **Pronouns:** "this approach," "these improvements"
- **Repetition:** Repeating key terms (CBT, anxiety, treatment)
- **Logical sequence:** General → Specific → Evidence → Analysis

---

### 9. Paragraph Length: The Balance

**Optimal Paragraph Length:**
- **Academic Standard:** 100-200 words (4-8 sentences)
- **Too Short:** Suggests underdeveloped ideas
- **Too Long:** Risks losing reader attention, may contain multiple ideas

**Paragraph Length Guidelines:**
- **Introduction paragraphs:** 3-5 sentences (hook, context, thesis)
- **Body paragraphs:** 5-8 sentences (topic sentence, evidence, analysis, connection)
- **Conclusion paragraphs:** 3-5 sentences (synthesis, implications, closing)

**When to Break a Paragraph:**
- You introduce a new main idea
- You shift to a different aspect of your argument
- You move from one piece of evidence to another
- You change time periods or contexts

---

### 10. Complete Paragraph Example

**Complete Example Paragraph:**

"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively treats anxiety disorders by systematically addressing maladaptive thought patterns that contribute to excessive worry and fear. Recent research demonstrates this effectiveness: Smith et al. (2023) conducted a randomized controlled trial with 150 participants diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, finding that 78% of participants receiving 12 weeks of CBT showed clinically significant symptom reduction, compared to only 35% in the waitlist control group. This substantial difference—more than double the improvement rate—suggests that CBT's structured approach to identifying and challenging cognitive distortions directly targets the underlying mechanisms of anxiety, rather than merely managing symptoms. Furthermore, longitudinal follow-up data from the same study revealed that these improvements were maintained at 6-month assessments, indicating that the cognitive restructuring techniques taught in CBT create lasting changes in how individuals process anxiety-provoking situations. These findings align with established cognitive models of anxiety, which propose that maladaptive thought patterns perpetuate anxiety cycles, and that interrupting these patterns through structured cognitive interventions produces measurable therapeutic benefits."

**Example Paragraph Breakdown:**
1. **Sentence 1:** Topic sentence (clear claim)
2. **Sentence 2:** Evidence with specific data and citation
3. **Sentence 3:** Analysis explaining the evidence
4. **Sentence 4:** Additional evidence (follow-up data)
5. **Sentence 5:** Connection to broader theory

### 11. Common Paragraph Problems

**Problems and Solutions:**
- **No clear topic sentence** → Start with a specific, arguable claim
- **Evidence without analysis** → Always explain how evidence supports your claim
- **Multiple unrelated ideas** → One main idea per paragraph
- **Weak transitions** → Use transition words and logical connections
- **Too short (underdeveloped)** → Add evidence, analysis, and connections
- **Too long (multiple ideas)** → Split into multiple paragraphs
- **No connection to thesis** → Show how paragraph supports main argument

**Self-Check Questions:**
- Can I identify the main point of this paragraph in one sentence?
- Do I have specific evidence supporting that point?
- Have I explained how the evidence supports my point?
- Do all sentences relate to the main point?
- Does this paragraph connect to my overall thesis?

---

### 12. Paragraph Types in Psychology Writing

**Introduction Paragraphs:**
- **Purpose:** Hook reader, provide context, state thesis
- **Structure:** General topic → Specific focus → Research question → Thesis statement

**Body Paragraphs:**
- **Purpose:** Develop one aspect of your argument
- **Structure:** Topic sentence → Evidence → Analysis → Connection

**Conclusion Paragraphs:**
- **Purpose:** Synthesize findings, discuss implications, provide closure
- **Structure:** Restate main points → Synthesize findings → Implications → Future directions

---

### 13. Transitions Between Sentences

**Intra-Paragraph Transitions:**
- **Function:** Connect sentences within a paragraph to create smooth flow
- **Types:** Logical connectors, pronouns, repetition, parallel structure

**Transition Categories:**
- **Addition:** Furthermore, Additionally, Moreover, In addition
- **Elaboration:** Specifically, In particular, For example
- **Contrast:** However, Nevertheless, On the other hand, In contrast
- **Cause/Effect:** Therefore, Consequently, As a result, Thus
- **Sequence:** First, Second, Then, Finally, Subsequently

**Advanced Transition Technique:**
Use pronouns and repetition to create flow without overusing transition words: "CBT treats anxiety. This approach helps individuals identify problematic thoughts. These cognitive patterns contribute to anxiety symptoms."

### 14. Practice Exercise: Building a Paragraph

**Task:** Construct a complete paragraph using:
- **Topic Sentence (provided):** "Mindfulness meditation effectively reduces stress in college students by improving emotional regulation and attention control."
- **Evidence to use:**
  - Goyal et al. (2014): 8-week mindfulness program reduced stress by 23% in college students (N=120)
  - Tang et al. (2015): Brief daily mindfulness practice improved attention and reduced cortisol levels
  - Follow-up study: Effects maintained at 3-month assessment

**Requirements:**
- Start with the topic sentence
- Integrate the evidence smoothly with citations
- Add analysis explaining how evidence supports the topic sentence
- Use transitions to connect sentences
- Aim for 5-7 sentences total

---

### 15. Revision Strategy: Paragraph Analysis

**Systematic Paragraph Revision Steps:**
1. Identify the topic sentence
2. Check for evidence supporting the topic sentence
3. Verify that analysis explains the evidence
4. Ensure all sentences relate to the main point
5. Check transitions between sentences
6. Verify paragraph connects to thesis

**Revision Checklist:**
- ✓ Topic sentence is clear and specific
- ✓ Evidence is specific and properly cited
- ✓ Analysis connects evidence to topic sentence
- ✓ All sentences support the main point
- ✓ Transitions create smooth flow
- ✓ Paragraph length is appropriate (100-200 words)
- ✓ Paragraph connects to overall argument

**Metacognitive Strategy:**
Read your paragraph aloud. If you pause or stumble, that's likely where coherence breaks down. If you can't identify the main point in one sentence, your topic sentence needs work.

### 16. Psychology-Specific Paragraph Patterns

**Literature Review Paragraphs:**
- **Structure:** Research finding → Study details → Analysis → Connection to your argument

**Methodology Paragraphs:**
- **Structure:** Procedure description → Participant details → Measures used → Analysis approach

**Results Paragraphs:**
- **Structure:** Finding statement → Statistical details → Effect size → Interpretation

---

### 17. Integrating Sentence-Level Skills

**From Lesson 1: Sentence-Level Skills**
- Sentence variety (short and medium sentences)
- Grammar precision (modifiers, parallel structure)
- Voice selection (active vs. passive)
- Transitions and varied beginnings

**Now Apply to Paragraphs:**
- Use sentence variety within paragraphs to create rhythm
- Vary sentence lengths to emphasize key points
- Use strategic voice choices (active for literature review, passive for methodology)
- Apply transitions to connect sentences smoothly

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Paragraph structure requires four components:** Topic sentence, evidence, analysis, and connection to main argument
2. **Topic sentences must be specific and arguable** - not vague observations or facts
3. **Evidence needs context and analysis** - don't just drop citations, explain what they mean
4. **Coherence comes from transitions, pronouns, and logical sequence** - each sentence should build on the previous
5. **Paragraph length matters** - 100-200 words (4-8 sentences) is the academic standard
6. **Sentence-level skills from Lesson 1 combine with paragraph structure** - both are necessary for strong writing
