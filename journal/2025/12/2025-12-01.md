Hi Ken,

I really appreciate the feedback you sent; it matters to me. After some more thinking  and a meeting with my measure-theory colleague, I've started to futher formalize these ideas and tried to solve some of the questions existed right now. And I found some part of this framework highly aligned with the note you just sent!

Your finding that physical feature changes eliminate the WFE suggests that "content" and "meaning" dimensions must be mathematically separable. This aligns perfectly with an **Orthogonal Distance Decomposition** approach I just developed:

1. Definitions: the world still starts with a sample space in a metric space (for now)

To answer your question on how to define content without circularity4:

- **Content ($\Omega$):** We assume the world starts with a Sample Space $\Omega$. "Items" are samples from this space. However, to be useful, these pure samples are expanded into a **Topological Vector Space** (e.g., a feature space). This allows us to calculate similarity ($d_{content}$).
    
- **Context ($\mathcal{M}$):** Context is strictly defined as the **Measure** $\mu$ on the sample space (the distribution of mass/attention).
    
- **Time ($T$):** I treat Time as a separate orthogonal axis that indexes the measures. (Mathematically, time is often treated as the index set for a stochastic process, distinct from the state space itself).
    

2. The Distance Theorem (The Answer to WFE)

We propose that total memory discriminability is the distance in the product space of these components. Assuming orthogonality (which your WFE results support), the distances sum geometrically:

$$D_{total}^2 = d_{content}^2 + d_{context}^2 + d_{time}^2$$

This addresses your intuition about "complex tones"5: just as acoustic frequencies are independent components of a wave, Content and Context are orthogonal metric components of a memory trace. If you change the physical form (as in your word vs. object experiment), you are effectively rotating the vector in the Content subspace, which zeroes out the correlation in the other dimensions.

3. The Mechanism: Collapse vs. Product Space

This framework provides a formal answer to your question: "When does adding information require creating a new representational space, and when is it just a metric deformation?"6.

- Global Matching (Metric Deformation/Collapse):
    
    This corresponds to an operator that collapses the product space. It projects $(x, c, t)$ down to just $x$.
    
    Mathematically: $(X_1, t_1) \to X_1$.
    
    Consequently, the system loses the ability to distinguish instances: $(X_1, t_1)$ is treated as equivalent to $(X_1, t_2)$. The distance between them becomes 0, and their signals sum (familiarity).
    
- Recollection/Positional Coding (New Representational Space):
    
    This requires preserving the full product space.
    
    Mathematically: $(X_1, t_1) \neq (X_1, t_2)$.
    
    Even if the content is identical ($d_{content} = 0$), the distance in the time/context dimension ($d_{time} > 0$) ensures the total discriminability is non-zero.
    

This seems to offer a cleaner mathematical way to represent the "Content vs. Context" relationship you noted in the PDF. It moves us away from vague verbal definitions and toward a geometric definition where "Context" is simply the preservation of the orthogonal metric dimensions that Global Matching usually collapses.

I’m writing up the formal proofs for this "Distance Decomposition" now. Does this distinction—between **collapsing the measure** (Global Matching) vs. **preserving the product space** (Recollection)—align with how you view the "structural" differences in the General Theory?

Best,

Lea

This is a brilliant theoretical jump. You have identified exactly _why_ REM (Shiffrin & Steyvers) behaves differently from MINERVA 2 or TODAM, even though they are all "Global Matching" models.

You are describing the difference between **Isotropic Matching** (Euclidean/Cosine) and **Anisotropic Matching** (Weighted/Bayesian).

Here is the deep dive discussion on how this maps to your "Content Expansion" and "Rotation vs. Extension" insights.

### 1. The Math: From Product to Weighted Dot Product

You mentioned that REM changes from a "weighted product to dot weighted product." Let's formalize this.

- Traditional Global Matching (e.g., MINERVA 2):
    
    Calculates resonance ($I$) essentially as a dot product (or cubed dot product) of the Probe ($P$) and Trace ($T$).
    
    $$I = \sum (P_i \cdot T_i)$$
    
    Here, every feature $i$ contributes equally (or polynomially). This implies the metric space is Euclidean (flat).
    
- REM (Bayesian Likelihood):
    
    Calculates the Odds Ratio ($\lambda$).
    
    $$\lambda = \prod_{j} \frac{P(Match | Same)}{P(Match | Diff)}$$
    
    If we take the Logarithm of this (to visualize the geometry), it transforms from a product to a sum:
    
    $$\log(\lambda) = \sum_{j} \underbrace{\log\left(\frac{P(M|S)}{P(M|D)}\right)}_{Weight_j} \cdot \mathbb{I}(Match_j)$$
    
    **This confirms your insight:** REM is mathematically a **Weighted Dot Product**.
    
    - The "Weight" ($w_j$) is determined by the **information content** of that feature.
        
    - Common features (high probability) $\to$ Low weight.
        
    - Rare features (low probability, Geometric tail) $\to$ Massive weight.
        

### 2. Geometric Distribution = The "Fat Tail" Differentiator

You are correct that the Gaussian distribution (used in summing similarity) falls off too fast to allow for "one-shot" differentiation of highly similar items.

- **Gaussian (Thin Tail):** In standard models, noise is Gaussian. Extreme matches are exponentially rare. The model "blurs" differences.
    
- **Geometric (Fat Tail):** In REM, feature values follow $P(v) = g(1-g)^{v-1}$.
    
    - If a probe and trace match on a _rare_ value (e.g., value = 20), the denominator $P(Match|Diff)$ becomes tiny.
        
    - The ratio blows up.
        
    - **Result:** A single distinct feature can dominate the decision. This allows REM to say "This is definitely Item A, not Item B" even if they share 90% of their features, provided the 10% difference lies in the "fat tail."
        

In your framework:

The Measure $\mu$ on the Content Space is Non-Uniform. The "distance" between items is not linear; it is warped by the rarity of the features.

### 3. "Rotation vs. Extension": The Vector Space Interpretation

This is your most powerful visual insight.

#### A. Magnitude Extension (Traditional GM / Strength)

When you study an item more in MINERVA or SAM:

- You add +1 to the frequency or sum vectors.
    
- **Geometry:** The vector gets **Longer**.
    
- **Effect:** It becomes easier to find (higher energy), but it points in the same direction. It does not become more _distinct_ from its neighbors.
    

#### B. Rotation (REM / Quality)

When you encode in REM (assuming error-prone copying):

- You don't just "add strength." You are slowly replacing "unknown" features (zeros or noise) with "correct" features.
    
- **Geometry:** The vector **Rotates**.
    
    - Initially, the trace is a fuzzy guess (pointing generally towards "Apple").
        
    - As you add "Quality" (rare, diagnostic features), the vector pivots to point exactly at "Granny Smith Apple" and _away_ from "Red Delicious Apple."
        
- **Why Rotation is Differentiation:**
    
    - If Vector A and Vector B are parallel (angle 0), they are confused.
        
    - "Extension" keeps them parallel.
        
    - "Rotation" changes the angle. A weighted product (where rare features pull harder) effectively rotates the basis of the space so that A and B become orthogonal.
        

### 4. How to represent this in your Framework?

You asked: _"How would weighted product be reflected in my framework right here?"_

You need to define your Content Space not just as a Vector Space, but as a **Riemannian Manifold** (or simply a weighted Metric Space).

Instead of the standard distance:

$$d(x, y)^2 = \sum (x_i - y_i)^2$$

Your framework uses the Information-Weighted Distance:

$$d_W(x, y)^2 = (x - y)^T \mathbf{W} (x - y)$$

Where $\mathbf{W}$ is a diagonal matrix (the metric tensor) derived from the **Inverse Probability** (the Geometric distribution) of the features.

- **Ken's Wave Idea:** This maps perfectly to Ken's "Complex Tone" idea.
    
    - Extension = Turning up the volume (Amplitude).
        
    - Rotation/REM = Changing the timbre/frequency composition. A "C-Major" chord is distinct from "C-Minor" not because of volume, but because of the specific _intervals_ (the weighted relationship between tones).
        

### Summary for your Discussion

When you discuss this with your colleague or Ken:

1. **Standard GM** assumes a **Flat Euclidean Space** (Magnitude dominates).
    
2. **REM** assumes a **Curved/Weighted Space** (Direction/Quality dominates).
    
3. The **Geometric Distribution** provides the "curvature" (the weights) that allows the model to separate similar items by "rotating" them apart based on rare features.
    

Does this mapping of "Rotation = Weighted Product = Feature Rarity" align with what you were visualizing?
