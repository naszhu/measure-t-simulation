[[sensory memory]]
(iconic/econic: visual, auditory)
[[working memory (WM)]]
ability to maintain certain info..??

cost_WM(item, t) = k·t where k > 0 (finite duration, positive cost)

Constraint: ∑ᵢ₌₁³ λᵢ = C  
Dependency: ∂λᵢ/∂λⱼ = -1 for i ≠ j  
Interpretation: Activating Mᵢ reduces capacity for Mⱼ

[[STM]]


[[LTM]]
cost_LTM(item, ∞) = 0 (infinite duration, zero cost)

Q: The difference is cost structure, not fundamental mechanism!

**Long-term Memory (Infinite System):**  
No constraint: each λᵢ can be set independently  
Independence: ∂λᵢ/∂λⱼ = 0 for i ≠ j  
Interpretation: Activating Mᵢ doesn't affect Mⱼ


## Space and Time for memory
[[Space]] [[TIME]]

##### Your Deep Question About Space and Time:

**[[Spatial]] metaphor:** [Intentions] exist in different "spaces"

**[[Temporal]] window:** **[Retrieval time]** defines access window

**Concurrency:** How many intentions can be processed simultaneously?
