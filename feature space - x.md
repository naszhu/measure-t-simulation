[[data space x]]

[[feature dimensions]] (x, y, z,... the axis)


could be feature space of [[feature vector]] and also for [[Configuration - X]]..?? really? rigerously mathemtaically? [[Question]],

=> well, sort of makes sense, because they are all some description of the "data space", not sample space 

[[Question]]: is [[similarity space]] a kind of feature space as well? (i think so)
